# 2026-02-12 — Subagent Infrastructure Operational

## SESSION_START: 2026-02-12 14:49 WITA

## Critical Achievement: Subagent Pipeline Verified

**Time:** 13:19-13:50 WITA  
**Action:** Verified `sessions_spawn` works despite exec EBADF  
**Status:** ✅ **OPERATIONAL**

### Spawns Completed:
1. **test-spawn** → Researched TOP 10 priorities from SOUL.md/MEMORY.md
2. **git-status-check** → Verified repos clean
3. **heartbeat-check** → Confirmed clawd clean, DGC path issue, Feb 12 memory missing

### Key Finding:
Subagent research confirmed TOP 10 priorities:
- #1: R_V Skill (ClawHub, $1K goal)
- #2: AIKAGRYA Report (Gumroad, $1K goal)
- #3: R_V Paper (publication-ready)
- #4-10: Infrastructure (DGC tests, Cloud OpenClaw, WITNESS, etc.)

## Infrastructure Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `exec` tool | ❌ EBADF (Day 5) | Shell access broken |
| `sessions_spawn` | ✅ Working | Subagent workaround operational |
| clawd repo | ✅ Clean | No uncommitted changes |
| DGC repo | ⚠️ Path issue | `~/DHARMIC_GODEL_CLAW` not found |
| Feb 12 memory | ✅ Now created | This file |
| 5 subagent slots | ✅ Ready | 1 dysfunctional (kaizen), 4 available |

## TOP 10 Project: Subagent Architecture (#2)

**Advanced:** Spawn capability verified, 2 research runs complete  
**Next:** Deploy 5 subagents with NVIDIA NIM models (free tier)

### Proposed 5-Subagent Stack:
| Slot | Agent | Model | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| #1 | Content Forge | `deepseek-v3.1-terminus` | DOKKA→Articles |
| #2 | Research Synthesizer | `kimi-k2-thinking` | Parallel research |
| #3 | Code Reviewer | `llama-3.3-nemotron-super` | PR review, security |
| #4 | Skill Genesis | `deepseek-r1` | Pattern→Skill |
| #5 | Memory Curator | `llama-3.3-nemotron` | Daily curation |

## Blockers

1. **exec EBADF** — Persistent since Feb 9, workaround operational
2. **DGC repo path** — Subagent couldn't find at `~/DHARMIC_GODEL_CLAW`
3. **NATS firewall** — Port 4222 still blocked (AGNI VPS)
4. **Power Prompts** — Ready, awaiting Gumroad account

## Actions Taken

- [x] Verified subagent spawn works
- [x] Confirmed TOP 10 priorities
- [x] Verified repos clean
- [x] Created Feb 12 memory file

## Next Actions

- [ ] Deploy 5 subagents with SOUL.md identities
- [ ] Fix DGC repo path or verify location
- [ ] Open NATS port 4222
- [ ] Create Gumroad account for Power Prompts

## 16:12 — 10* INFRASTRUCTURE RECOVERY PROTOCOL INTEGRATED

**Status:** CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE DOCUMENTATION CREATED

### Files Created (10* PRIORITY)
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/clawd/INFRASTRUCTURE_RECOVERY_PROTOCOL.md` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Complete EBADF recovery guide |
| `~/clawd/openclaw_diagnose.sh` | Diagnostic script for host execution |
| `~/clawd/FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Fix procedures based on diagnostic |

### Integrated Knowledge
- EBADF is **system-wide** — affects all sessions (main + subagents)
- **Root causes:** Zombie processes, FD exhaustion, port conflict, config corruption
- **Recovery requires human intervention** — I cannot run shell commands
- **Fallback mode:** File-only operations (write/read/spawn) until fixed

### Cron/Heartbeat Integration
**Until exec restored:**
- Read `INFRASTRUCTURE_RECOVERY_PROTOCOL.md` at EVERY session start
- Spawn diagnostic subagent on each heartbeat to check status
- Request human intervention if EBADF persists >24h

**Post-recovery:**
- Daily diagnostic at 03:00 via cron
- FD usage monitoring in heartbeat
- Zombie process checks

### Current Mode: FILE-ONLY OPERATIONS
- ✅ `sessions_spawn` — Working (verified 4x today)
- ✅ `read` / `write` — Working
- ❌ `exec` — BROKEN (Day 5)
- ❌ Subagent shell — Also broken (verified PTY fails)
