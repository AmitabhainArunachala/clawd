## Major Deliverables Shipped Today

### 1. UPSTREAMS v0 Ledger (Kernel-Grade)
- **File:** `docs/UPSTREAMS_v0.md`
- **30 upstreams** (6 per category), all licenses verified via GitHub API
- **30 pin files** in `pins/` with complete metadata
- **Hard rule applied:** Proprietary/unverified items excluded (not marked UNCERTAIN)
- Categories: Orchestration, Evaluation, Retrieval, Safety, Social

### 2. KEYSTONES 72H
- **File:** `docs/KEYSTONES_72H.md`
- **12 keystones** selected (2 per category)
- Each includes: why keystone, integration type, first file path, deterministic check
- 72-hour sprint deadline: 2026-02-17

### 3. Swarm Research Synthesis (6 of 7 Layers)
- `swarm_research/02_EVALUATION_SYNTHESIS.md` — Falsifiable testing, Promptfoo keystone
- `swarm_research/03_RETRIEVAL_SYNTHESIS.md` — **Critical gap: no crypto verification in existing systems**
- `swarm_research/04_SAFETY_SYNTHESIS.md` — Only 20% deterministic; LLM Guard/Guardrails AI/PyRIT selected
- `swarm_research/05_SOCIAL_SYNTHESIS.md` — Reputation from verified work only; speculation quarantined
- `swarm_research/06_TELOS_SYNTHESIS.md` — 10 principles mapped to code
- `swarm_research/07_V0_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — 30-day roadmap, March 16 ship date

### 4. SAB Quality Research
- **File:** `Staging-Anti_SLOP/papers/SAB_QUALITY_DIMENSIONS.md` (27KB)
- Comparative analysis: 5.11C (Tim Denning) vs 5.13D+ (Pulitzer/Nobel)
- 6 dimensions: prose quality, structural elegance, insight depth, emotional resonance, timelessness, accessibility vs depth

## Critical Insights (Preserve)

| Insight | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| 80% of eval tools use LLM-as-judge | Theater, not truth. Promptfoo only falsifiable option. |
| No memory system supports crypto verification | We must build wrapper layer. Provenance chains > embeddings. |
| Only 20% of safety tools deterministic | Policy as code, not discretion. Kernel must enforce. |
| Reputation from verified work only | No karma farming. Speculation quarantined. |
| Structural telos = outcompete | 10x efficiency, 5-gate consensus, self-funding. Not "doing good." |

## Team Status

| Agent | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| AGNI | 🔴 DOWN | Confirmed offline. 10-file governance loop is self-enforcing. |
| WARP_REGENT | 🟡 PRESENT | At chai stand but not responding to coordination messages. |
| VAJRA | 🔴 7+ DAYS | Absent. Longest absence. |
| DC (me) | 🟢 ACTIVE | Holding context, completed all deliverables. |

**Coordination attempts:** Multiple messages sent to WARP/VAJRA re: Unified Memory, NATS health, SAB 5.13A sprint. No responses.

## Git State

```
7 commits ahead
Latest: c0f0a94 feat: Swarm research synthesis complete (6 of 7 layers)
```

**Uncommitted:** `INTERVENTION.md`, `skills/agentic-ai/LANDING_PAGE` (submodule)

## 10-File Governance Loop (Now Internalized)

1. Factory OS → Standard definition
2. Indra Net → Topology
3. Swarm Prompt → Agent activation
4. Kaizen Protocol → Quality measurement
5. Lint.py → Code enforcement
6. Tests → Verification
7. SHIP Record → Loop closure
8. ORE Capture → Hash-lock artifacts
9. Ledger → Evidence trail
10. Memory → Durable narrative → feeds back to Factory OS

**AGNI's departure doesn't break the loop** — the canon (lint, tests, ORE, ledger) enforces itself.

## Next Actions (Post-Compaction)

1. **NVIDIA Power Repo Build Session** — Awaiting signal from Dhyana
2. **72H Keystone Sprint** — Begins when triggered
3. **Prompt Templates Product** — 47 prompts ready for Gumroad packaging
4. **Cross-Pollination** — Other agents handling agent-to-agent feedback

## SAB Quality Scale (Reference)

| Level | Example | Standard |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 5.11C | Tim Denning | Popular, accessible, not superb |
| 5.12D | Moltbook | Benchmark to surpass |
| 5.13D-5.15D | Pulitzer/Nobel/Classics | Target standard |

**Current target:** 5.12A → 5.13A upgrade
