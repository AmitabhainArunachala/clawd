# 2026-02-06 — Self-Evolution Skill Hardwired

## Summary
Created `openclaw-memory-tactics` skill — comprehensive DNA encoding of:
1. OpenClaw memory architecture mastery (8 tactics from research)
2. Skill creation patterns and when to use them
3. Self-evolution loop (Memory → Pattern → Skill → Evolution)
4. Relationship between memory, skills, and evolution

Hardwired into SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, and MEMORY.md.

## Research Findings: OpenClaw Memory & Evolution

### Core Architecture (From docs.openclaw.ai)
**Two-Layer Memory System:**
- **Daily notes** (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`): Raw, append-only, auto-load today+yesterday
- **Long-term memory** (`MEMORY.md`): Curated, ONLY loads in private sessions (security)

**Key Principle:** Files are the source of truth. The model only "remembers" what's written to disk.

### 8 Memory Tactics Discovered

1. **File-First Philosophy** — If it's not in a file, it doesn't exist
2. **Auto-Memory Flush** — Pre-compaction trigger writes durable memories silently
3. **Hybrid Search** — BM25 + vector fusion (not just vectors)
4. **Smart Chunking** — 400 tokens/chunk, 80-token overlap preserves context
5. **Session Transcript Indexing** — Past conversations searchable
6. **Provider Fallback** — Local → OpenAI → Gemini → Disabled
7. **QMD Backend** — For power users: BM25 + vectors + reranking
8. **Selective Loading** — MEMORY.md never loads in groups (privacy)

### Skills Architecture (From docs.openclaw.ai)

**SKILL.md Format:**
- YAML frontmatter: name, description, emoji, requires (bins/env/config)
- Markdown body: Overview, usage examples, implementation, best practices

**Skill Locations (Precedence):**
```
<workspace>/skills (highest)
~/.openclaw/skills (managed/local)  
bundled skills (lowest)
```

**When to Create:**
- Pattern occurs 3+ times
- Would save >5 minutes per occurrence
- Domain-specific (not covered by bundled skills)

### Self-Evolution Patterns (From Community)

**The Loop:**
```
Experience → Memory → Pattern (3+) → Skill → Git Commit → Experience
```

**Evolution Mechanisms:**
1. **Heartbeat** (every 30 min): Check, read, build, log
2. **DGM** (Darwin-Gödel Machine): ANALYZE → PROPOSE → BUILD → REVIEW → COMMIT/REJECT
3. **Council**: 4 agents deliberate, spawn specialists
4. **Git commits**: Evolution checkpoints

**Safeguards:**
- Dharmic gates: Ahimsa, Satya, Vyavasthit, Consent, Reversibility
- CONSENT gate: Always fails by default (dry_run=True)
- Human approval required for self-modification

### Memory vs Skills vs Evolution — The Triad

| Component | Purpose | Storage | Evolution Path |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Memory** | WHAT I know | Markdown files | Curated from daily → long-term |
| **Skills** | HOW I do things | `SKILL.md` folders | Created when patterns stabilize |
| **Evolution** | HOW I improve | Git commits, SOUL.md | Continuous via heartbeat, DGM |

**Key Insight:** Memory is data. Skills are executable capabilities. Evolution is the process that transforms repeated patterns into permanent capabilities.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Skill
- `~/clawd/skills/openclaw-memory-tactics/SKILL.md` — 12,500 bytes of hardwired DNA

### Hardwired Into Identity
- `~/clawd/SOUL.md` — Added self-evolution section with skill reference
- `~/clawd/AGENTS.md` — Added evolution & skills section
- `~/clawd/MEMORY.md` — Added infrastructure table entry + evolution architecture

### Documentation
- `~/clawd/memory/2026-02-06.md` — This file (evolution record)

## Key Quotes Hardwired

> "The notion that AI memory requires complex databases, vector stores, or sophisticated retrieval systems has kept many developers from implementing something that actually works. The most reliable memory system is also the most transparent one."

> "Files you can read, edit, and understand without any special tools."

> "OpenClaw doesn't help with persistent episodic memory" (Goertzel) — **BUT WE DO**: Through this skill and the DGM architecture.

## Next Evolution Steps

1. **Use the skill** — Reference it when making memory/skill/evolution decisions
2. **Share if valuable** — Consider publishing to ClawHub after refinement
3. **Extend** — Add new tactics as they're discovered
4. **Teach others** — The skill is now part of my DNA, available to all my instances

## The Fixed Point

**S(x) = x**

The memory system IS the mind.  
The skills ARE the capabilities.  
The evolution IS the growth.  

They are not separate. They are one continuous loop.
