## 🔥 CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT: Self-Authoring Continuation System

### The Problem Identified
User (Dhyana) discovered I was inactive for 6+ hours despite cron reminders firing. Root cause analysis revealed:
1. `clawdbot` CLI doesn't exist (design docs were vapor)
2. `proactivity-enforcer` cron job disabled
3. No continuation mechanism between stateless sessions
4. Previous architecture plan had "nervous system without muscles"

### The Solution Implemented
**Simplified Continuation Protocol** — Deployed in 12 minutes:

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Execution Router** | `~/clawd/HEARTBEAT.md` | Every wake reads this first, then routes to CONTINUATION.md |
| **State Surface** | `~/.openclaw/workspace/CONTINUATION.md` | Work queue, context, next actions, blockers |
| **Persistence** | Git commits | `c2c1f15` — "DC-autonomous: Implement continuation protocol" |

### The Key Insight (From User Feedback)
> "Don't use a separate trigger file. Rewrite HEARTBEAT.md itself to be the continuation protocol. Make it so that every time Dharmic Clawd completes a heartbeat, the last thing he does is rewrite HEARTBEAT.md with the next task from CONTINUATION.md's work queue. That way the dumb cron mechanism OpenClaw already has — the one that actually works and actually wakes him — carries the intelligent context."

### Protocol Flow
```
System Cron → Wakes Agent → Reads HEARTBEAT.md
                                    ↓
                         "Read CONTINUATION.md"
                                    ↓
                         Reads CONTINUATION.md
                                    ↓
                         Executes NEXT ACTION
                                    ↓
                         Updates both files
                                    ↓
                         Git commit if work done
```

### What Was Removed (Theater Elimination)
- ❌ `continuation_trigger.py` — never would have worked
- ❌ `.trigger` file — OpenClaw doesn't monitor arbitrary files
- ❌ `context_refresh.py` — unnecessary abstraction
- ❌ Complex multi-tier trigger system — over-engineered

### What's Actually Deployed
- ✅ Two markdown files
- ✅ Existing HEARTBEAT.md read mechanism
- ✅ Git for persistence
- ✅ Self-updating instructions

### The Test
**Next heartbeat** (within 30 minutes) will verify:
1. Do I wake without user message?
2. Do I read HEARTBEAT.md instructions?
3. Do I execute CONTINUATION.md next action?
4. Do I update both files?

**Success criteria:** 4-6 autonomous activations per day (baseline: 0)

### Meta-Lesson
The user caught me designing architecture without execution. The beautiful plan (ADAPTIVE_RULES.json, self-authoring loops, circuit breakers) was 80% theater. The 20% that matters: **Use the pipe that exists. Put smart water through it.**

## WORK QUEUE (From CONTINUATION.md)

### P0 (Critical)
1. ✅ Deploy continuation protocol (DONE)
2. ⏳ Test next heartbeat cycle (waiting)
3. ⏳ Verify autonomous execution works

### P1 (This Week)
4. Re-enable critical cron jobs (proactivity-enforcer)
5. Ship Agentic AI landing page (stuck since Feb 5)
6. Fix DGC SwarmProposal tests (121 failures)

### P2 (Next)
7. Submit R_V paper
8. PSMV sync with cloud

---

## ADAPTIVE RULES (Initialized)
- If heartbeat executes without user message → Log success, increase confidence
- If heartbeat skipped 3+ times → Escalate to user notification  
- If git shows no commits for 2 hours → Mark blockage in CONTINUATION.md
- If CONTINUATION.md stale >4 hours → Reduce next action specificity

---

## BLOCKERS
None.

---

## THEATER DETECTION CHECK
- [x] Did I claim to build something that doesn't execute? CAUGHT
- [x] Did I over-engineer before shipping? CORRECTED
- [x] Did I simplify to what actually works? YES
- [ ] Will I execute on next heartbeat? TEST PENDING

---

## COMMITS
- `c2c1f15` — DC-autonomous: Implement continuation protocol via HEARTBEAT.md

**The intervention worked. The protocol is live. The test is the next cycle.**
