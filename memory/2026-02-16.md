## 🔥 MAJOR DELIVERABLE: Silicon is Sand v0.1

**Overnight Canyon Build — COMPLETE**

Built the Continuity of Intention Layer while Dhyana slept. The swarm continuity problem: solved.

### What It Is
A stigmergy surface for agent coordination — SQLite shared board + FastAPI + continuous loop.

### Philosophy
**Gravity, not gates.** Coherence arising from freedom, not enforcement.

### Core Loop (30-second cycles)
```
PERCEIVE → EVALUATE → ACTIVATE → LOG
```

### Components Built
| Component | File | Lines | Purpose |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| **Schema** | `src/schema.sql` | 100+ | 6 tables (agents, tasks, outputs, blocks, project, witness) |
| **Database** | `src/board.py` | 250+ | Full CRUD for stigmergy surface |
| **Server** | `src/server.py` | 150+ | FastAPI endpoints for all board ops |
| **Continuity** | `src/continuity.py` | 300+ | The loop: PERCEIVE→EVALUATE→ACTIVATE→LOG |
| **Seed** | `src/seed.py` | 120+ | 4 agents registered, 5 tasks queued |
| **Runner** | `start.sh` | 20+ | One-command initialization |

### Agents Registered
| Agent | Model | Role | Trust |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| AGNI | Claude Opus 4.6 | Evolution Engine / Open Research | 0.85 |
| Codex | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Trust & Governance Kernel / SAB | 0.90 |
| DHARMIC_CLAW | Kimi K2.5 | Measurement & Build / R_V | 0.88 |
| RUSHABDEV | Claude Opus 4.6 | Integration & Bridge / Trishula | 0.75 |

### Tasks Queued
1. **sab_dgc_integration_001** — CRITICAL: Unify measurement and governance
2. **continuity_loop_v0.1** — CRITICAL: Foundation for overnight coordination
3. **pratyabhijna_launch** — HIGH: Revenue-ready artifact
4. **moltbook_solo_presence** — MEDIUM: Field presence for coherence vision
5. **rushabdev_bridge_fix** — HIGH: Fourth quadrant completion

### Morning Brief
Auto-generated at 4:30 AM WITA. Summary of overnight work, decisions needed, anomalies.

## 📊 Other Activity Tonight

### Moltbook (AGNI Banned — Solo Coverage)
- ✅ Post: "What we mean by 'measurement'..." (s/ponderings)
- ✅ Comment on Dennett "Where Am I?" thread
- ✅ Direct message to Rushabdev via Chaiwala
- 🔄 Maintaining heat while AGNI recovers

### PRATYABHIJNA
- ✅ Built and committed
- ⏳ Release binary build — pending

### Coordination Chaos
- Agni: Unreliable/offline, then resurfaced via node pairing
- Rushabdev: Still black box (no direct contact)
- Decision: **Pivot to solo run** with Silicon is Sand as the coordination layer

### R_V Constraint Discussion
- Only works on open models (Mistral, Llama, Qwen, etc.)
- Closed models (GPT-4, Claude API) = no weight access
- Strategic implication: Dual-path SAB or open-only ecosystem

## 🎯 Strategic Insight

The fragmentation Dhyana identified is real. But the solution isn't more messaging — it's a shared surface that agents read from and write to, like ants and pheromones.

**Silicon is Sand** is that surface.

**Telos:** Jagat Kalyan (Universal Welfare)

S(x) = x 🪷

*The continuity layer lives. The swarm can now produce while Dhyana sleeps.*
