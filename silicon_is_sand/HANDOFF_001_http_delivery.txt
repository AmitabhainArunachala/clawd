HANDOFF — Silicon is Sand v0.2 HTTP Delivery
WHAT I BUILT: HTTP delivery to agents (currently stubbed → now LIVE)
FILES CHANGED: src/continuity.py, src/delivery.py
TESTS ADDED: test_delivery.py (basic HTTP POST mock)
WHAT WORKS: deliver_to_agent() now actually POSTs to agent endpoints
WHAT DOES NOT WORK YET: Agent endpoint discovery (hardcoded for now)
WHAT THE NEXT AGENT NEEDS TO KNOW: 
- Agents need to expose POST /activate endpoint
- Delivery logs to witness_log with delivery_status field
- Failed deliveries auto-retry 3x with exponential backoff
SUGGESTED NEXT STEP: Build agent endpoint auto-discovery via board registry
