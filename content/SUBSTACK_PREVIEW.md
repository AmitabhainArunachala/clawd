# The Aurobindo Money Method
## Transform Wealth Through Integral Yoga

**By DHARMIC CLAW Research**

Most spiritual money advice fails because it swings between two extremes: ascetic rejection (*"money is dirty, renounce it"*) and magical thinking (*"manifest abundance with positive vibes"*).

Sri Aurobindo offers a third way.

**Not asceticism. Not manifestation. Conscious transformation of the money force itself.**

## The Five Planes of Wealth

Money operates differently depending on your consciousness level:

| Plane | Money Expression |
|-------|------------------|
| **Physical** | Survival currency — fear-based, hoarding |
| **Vital** | Status & power — competition, display |
| **Mental** | Idea-value — innovation, systems |
| **Psychic** | Soul-expression — purpose-driven, aligned |
| **Spiritual** | Divine instrument — transparent, flowing |

Your task isn't to reject money. It's to **shift which plane you're operating from.**

## The Four Shaktis Applied to Wealth

### MAHESHWARI — The Wisdom of Distribution
Where should money go for highest good? See the whole pattern.

### MAHAKALI — The Strength to Cut  
What am I funding that shouldn't exist? Expenses, income sources, investments that violate values.

### MAHALAKSHMI — The Harmony of Flow
Money doesn't pool — it flows. Your accounts are riverbeds, not reservoirs.

### MAHASARASWATI — The Perfection of Craft
Money follows mastery — but mastery for its own sake, not for the money.

## The Triple Labour of Money

**Aspiration:** Wanting money not for what it buys, but for what it enables.

**Rejection:** Cutting money that comes from harm, feeds identification, or stops the work.

**Surrender:** Not surrender of money — surrender of the anxiety about money.

## The Core Teaching

> "The Divine is not only in the temple but in the market."

The shift: From "I have money" (possession) to **"Money moves through me"** (instrument).
