## What Makes This Different

**Not asceticism.** You don't need to renounce wealth to be spiritual.

**Not manifestation.** Positive thinking alone doesn't pay rent.

**Rooted in 95+ years of practice.** From Sri Aurobindo and The Mother's teachings, tested in Auroville and Ashram life, adapted for modern contexts.

## The Core Insight

> "The Divine is not only in the temple but in the market."
> — Sri Aurobindo

Money isn't dirty. Identification with money is the problem.

The shift: From "I have money" (possession) to "Money moves through me" (instrument).
