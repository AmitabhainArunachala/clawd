## Step 5: Use the Output

Don't just read—act:
- Save useful outputs to your notes
- Modify prompts that don't quite fit
- Build your own variations

---

## Pro Tips

**Chain prompts:** Use #7 Synthesis on outputs from #2 Recursive Analysis for deeper insight.

**Build templates:** Save modified versions in your note app (Notion, Obsidian, etc).

**Track ROI:** Note which prompts save time vs which just feel useful. Double down on winners.

**The Meta-Prompt:** When stuck, ask AI: "What would you ask me to clarify before helping?"

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Copying without customizing** — The bracketed sections exist for a reason  
✅ **Fill in your specifics for relevant output**

❌ **Expecting magic** — AI amplifies clarity; it doesn't replace thinking  
✅ **Use prompts to structure your thinking, not outsource it**

❌ **Using the same prompt for everything** — Match tool to task  
✅ **Scan the categories, pick intentionally**
