## 47 Battle-Tested Prompts That Transform Generic AI Output Into Specialized Expertise

---

## Stop Writing From Scratch Every Time

You know the feeling. You open ChatGPT, stare at the blank input, and... type the same vague request you typed yesterday.

**The result?** Generic output that needs heavy editing. Hours wasted on iteration. The promise of AI productivity that never quite materializes.

Here's what nobody tells you: **The people getting 10x value from AI aren't better prompters. They have a library.**

They don't craft from nothing. They select, customize, execute. The difference between amateur and expert isn't talent—it's tooling.

## Sample Prompt

**The Steel-Man Protocol**

```
You are my intellectual sparring partner. Your task is to construct the strongest possible version of the opposing view to [MY POSITION]. Do not strawman. Do not weaken for rhetorical effect. If the opposing view has merit, acknowledge it. If my position is weak, show me exactly where. Your goal is not to win—it's to help me stress-test my thinking.
```

**When to use:** Before publishing anything controversial, making irreversible decisions, or entering debates.

**Expected output:** Bullet-pointed argument map with premises, inferences, and potential rebuttals.

**Pro tip:** Run this twice—once for the opposition, once for your own view. Compare gaps.

---

## The Math

**Conservative estimate:** Each prompt saves you 10 minutes per use.

**Use 5 prompts per week** = 50 minutes saved weekly  
**Over one year** = 43 hours saved  
**At $50/hour** = $2,150 in recovered time

**Your investment:** $9 (one-time)

**ROI:** 239x in year one alone

**P.S.** The Steel-Man Protocol alone is worth the price. If it prevents just one bad decision, you've paid for the pack 100x over.

**P.P.S.** This isn't about "AI prompts." It's about thinking clearly. The prompts are just scaffolding for better cognition. The real product is the clarity.
