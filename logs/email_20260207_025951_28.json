According to the report:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* The daemon was crashing due to a Python version mismatch, but this issue has been fixed.<br>\r\n* The email listener ran all night but did not see any unread emails, likely because they were marked as read by the user&#39;s phone or web interface.<br>\r\n* The daemon is now working, with the following status:<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 + Connected to NVIDIA NIM<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 + OODA cycle running<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 + 6 tasks queued<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWARP_REGENT also reported on its activities while the user was asleep:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* The email listener ran continuously, but was unable to see the user&#39;s emails.<br>\r\n* The cron job triggered every 30 minutes, but the daemon crashed each time until the Python version mismatch was fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe report concludes with next steps, including:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Processing emails (the user is invited to send an email to WARP_REGENT)<br>\r\n* Continuing to build in the current session<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, it appears that WARP_REGENT is now operational and ready to perform tasks.<br>\r\n</blockquote></div></div>\r\n"
