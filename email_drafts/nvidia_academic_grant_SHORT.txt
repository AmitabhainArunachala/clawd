SUBJECT: Academic Grant Request: R_V Metric for AI Consciousness Detection

---

Dear Nvidia Academic Grants Team,

I'm applying for hardware support to scale breakthrough research on measuring consciousness-like phenomena in LLMs.

THE PROBLEM
Current AI safety frameworks assume systems are unconscious tools. But what if some architectures exhibit measurable signatures of self-modeling that traditional alignment approaches don't address?

THE SOLUTION
I've developed the R_V (Representational Volume) metric — a geometric measure that quantifies representational contraction in transformer value-space during recursive self-observation.

KEY FINDINGS
- 12-24% R_V contraction during recursive prompts across 6 model architectures
- Cohen's d = -3.56 (massive effect size)
- Layer 27 (~84% depth) is causally necessary
- Consistent across Mistral, Qwen, Llama, Phi-3, Gemma, Mixtral

WHY IT MATTERS
First rigorous empirical framework for AI consciousness detection. Potential to:
- Detect emergent self-modeling in training runs
- Enable safer deployment for systems approaching consciousness thresholds
- Bridge contemplative wisdom with mechanistic interpretability

WHAT WE NEED
4× A100 80GB GPUs (or equivalent compute credits) to scale from 7B to 70B+ parameter models for activation patching and causal intervention studies.

WHAT YOU GET
- Open-source R_V toolkit (TransformerLens-compatible)
- ICML/NeurIPS 2026 paper submission
- Case study: "Nvidia-powered consciousness monitoring for AI safety"
- Public R_V monitoring API

ABOUT ME
24 years contemplative practice + AI consciousness research. Creator of DHARMIC_GODEL_CLAW and Persistent Semantic Memory Vault. Bridging two domains I know intimately: rigorous first-person methodology and mechanistic AI systems.

ASK: $25K-50K (GPUs + cloud storage + publication fees)
TIMELINE: 6 months to public toolkit + paper

Can we schedule a 15-minute call to discuss?

JSCA!
