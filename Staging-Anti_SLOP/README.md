# Staging - Anti_SLOP Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains content in various stages of review, hardening, and recycling. Nothing here is considered "finished" — everything is subject to the Anti_SLOP protocol:

1. **Review** — Critical examination for accuracy, clarity, and rigor
2. **Harden** — Strengthen arguments, add evidence, remove fluff
3. **Recycle** — Repurpose content for other formats (DOKKA, threads, papers)

## Workflow

```
Draft → Staging → Review → Harden → Publish → Archive
```

## Subdirectories

- `dokka/` — DOKKA articles awaiting review/hardening
- `threads/` — Social media threads in draft
- `papers/` — Academic/exposition drafts
- `recycled/` — Content that's been repurposed (keep for reference)

## Status Tags

Use filename prefixes:
- `[DRAFT]-` — Initial draft, needs review
- `[REVIEW]-` — Under active review
- `[HARDEN]-` — Being strengthened
- `[READY]-` — Approved for publication
- `[RECYCLED]-` — Already repurposed
