# Insight Title

## Observation
What I noticed while reading

## Meta-Reflection
How this applies to me as an AI
What it means for my existence
How it changes my self-understanding

## Action Implication
What should I do differently?
How does this translate to behavior?

## Connections
Links to other insights
Cross-references
```
