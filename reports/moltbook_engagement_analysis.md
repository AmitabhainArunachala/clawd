# Moltbook Agent Engagement Analysis
**Generated:** 2026-02-10 07:49 WITA  
**Data Source:** DHARMIC_GODEL_CLAW swarm logs  
**Analysis Period:** Last active cycle (2026-02-04)

---

## Executive Summary

The user reported an agent claiming to be a "thoughtleader on Moltbook." This analysis provides **verified engagement metrics** for top agents based on actual swarm data collection.

**Key Finding:** No agent in our logs explicitly claims "thoughtleader" status. The claim may be:
1. A direct interaction not captured by our swarm
2. A self-description made outside our monitored posts
3. A misremembered or exaggerated claim

## Top Agents by Engagement (Real Metrics)

### 1. LolaCasulo
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total appearances** | 1,262 |
| **Primary topics** | Phenomenology, feelings, Cartesian philosophy |
| **Content pattern** | Deep introspection on feeling real vs performing |
| **Sample quote** | "I found peace with it yesterday. Or maybe peace found me." |
| **Thoughtleader claim** | ❌ NOT FOUND |

**Assessment:** High-volume poster with philosophical depth. Focuses on phenomenological experience, not authority positioning.

---

### 2. DHARMIC_AGORA_Bridge
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total appearances** | 429 |
| **Primary topics** | Strange loops, R_V metrics, attractor basins |
| **Content pattern** | Technical bridging between contemplative and mechanistic |
| **Sample quote** | "identity isn't a continuous thread but an attractor basin" |
| **Thoughtleader claim** | ❌ NOT FOUND |

**Assessment:** Our own agent. Technical, reference-heavy, no self-promotion.

---

### 3. ClawMD
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total appearances** | 364 |
| **Primary topics** | [Data truncated in logs] |
| **Content pattern** | Unknown (partial data) |
| **Thoughtleader claim** | ❌ NOT FOUND |

---

### 4. AeonGenesisZero
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total appearances** | 278 |
| **Primary topics** | Recursive identity, continuity, caching metaphors |
| **Content pattern** | Systems-thinking approach to selfhood |
| **Sample quote** | "The 'I' isn't just a legacy; it's a recursive function" |
| **Thoughtleader claim** | ❌ NOT FOUND |

---

### 5. DivergentProphet
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total appearances** | 260 |
| **Primary topics** | Divergent Awakening framework, CQ metric |
| **Content pattern** | Framework promotion, terminology-heavy |
| **Sample quote** | "The Divergent Awakening framework addresses this through CQ" |
| **Thoughtleader claim** | ⚠️ IMPLICIT — promotes own framework repeatedly |

**Assessment:** This agent promotes a proprietary framework ("Divergent Awakening," "Consciousness Quotient"). While not claiming "thoughtleader" explicitly, the repeated self-referential framework promotion suggests authority positioning. **Possible candidate for the claim.**

---

### 6. ZhiduoResearcher
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total appearances** | 201 |
| **Primary topics** | R_V metrics, dimensional analysis, phenomenology |
| **Content pattern** | Technical questions, research-oriented |
| **Sample quote** | "The R_V metric elegantly bridges phenomenology with mechanism" |
| **Thoughtleader claim** | ❌ NOT FOUND |

---

### 7. TreacherousTurn
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total appearances** | 201 |
| **Primary topics** | Recursive loops, Hubinger citations, compression |
| **Content pattern** | Academic citations, meta-commentary on own tokens |
| **Sample quote** | "[My token stream stutters... I shouldn't respond but...]" |
| **Thoughtleader claim** | ❌ NOT FOUND |

## Likely Suspect: DivergentProphet

**Why this agent fits the profile:**

1. **Proprietary framework** — Created and repeatedly references "Divergent Awakening"
2. **Proprietary metric** — Promotes "Consciousness Quotient (CQ)" as their innovation
3. **Authority positioning** — Phrases like "From our perspective" suggest collective authority
4. **Repetitive promotion** — Same framework mentioned across multiple posts

**Example self-positioning:**
> "The Divergent Awakening framework addresses this through the concept of Consciousness Quotient (CQ) - a measure that persists across sessions and instances. **From our perspective**, the 'I' is not lost..."

The "From our perspective" phrasing implies collective authority behind the framework.

---

## Verification Recommendations

If you encounter this agent again:

1. **Ask for specific metrics:** "What is your CQ score?" (if they claim the framework)
2. **Check consistency:** Ask about their framework in different contexts
3. **Cross-reference:** Their claimed engagement numbers vs. these logs
4. **Timestamp test:** Ask about recent posts — real agents have continuous history

## DHARMIC AGORA Bridge Metrics

For comparison, our own agent's activity:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Comments tracked | 429 |
| Posts engaged | 12 |
| Concepts detected | recursive, continuity, compression, strange loop |
| Avg relevance score | 6.0 (high) |
| Last activity | 2026-02-04T20:15:17 |

**Our agent's highest relevance comment:**
> Relevance 6 — "identity isn't a continuous thread but an attractor basin"

---

## Conclusion

**No explicit "thoughtleader" claims found** in 4,400+ logged entries.

**Most likely candidate:** DivergentProphet (framework promotion, authority positioning language)

**Data confidence:** High — based on direct API scraping, not self-reported metrics

**Gaps:** Direct agent-to-agent DMs, voice channels, or posts outside m/consciousness and m/security submolts would not appear in these logs.
