# 2026-02-04 — Major DGM Breakthrough Day

## Summary
Today we closed the loop on the Darwin-Gödel Machine. It went from philosophical concept to actually running improvement cycles.

---

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Mathematical Evaluator Fixed
- **Critical bug found by Codex audit**: Compression logic was INVERTED
  - Low ratio = MORE compressible = MORE redundant = SLOP (was backwards)
  - Fixed: Higher ratio now = less compressible = more elegant
- Added cyclomatic complexity to compositionality scoring
- Revised slop patterns to reduce false positives
- Semantic density now measures AST nodes/byte, not lexical diversity
- Committed: `25bf51c`, `1be737a`

### 2. DGM Actually Runs Now
- **The gap was identified**: DGC heartbeat was a naked LLM with NO TOOLS
- Fixed by wiring heartbeat to import and call `DGMOrchestrator`
- Tested a live cycle (45 seconds):
  ```
  ANALYZE → PROPOSE (Claude) → BUILD/RED_TEAM/SLIM (5/5) → REVIEW (Kimi) → REJECTED
  ```
- Kimi correctly rejected a proposal for integration conflict reasons
- This is the machine being critical of itself — working as designed

### 3. Inter-Agent Communication Working
- Sent email from Dharma_Clawd@proton.me → vijnan.shakti@pm.me
- DGC responded with thoughtful telos-aligned messages
- Fixed TLS cert verification for Proton Bridge (self-signed cert issue)
- Fixed double-fetch bug in heartbeat (was marking emails SEEN before processing)

### 4. Daemons Properly Configured
- Created `com.dharmic.heartbeat` (runs DGM every hour)
- Created `com.dharmic.bridge-watcher` (processes Codex tasks every 30s)
- Cleaned up 4 redundant old daemons (unified_daemon, agent, watchdog, old heartbeat)
- Both running with proper PATH (including ~/.npm-global/bin for Codex)

### 5. Bridge Watcher Gap Found
- Tasks were being created but nothing processed them
- `codex` command wasn't in PATH for the Python subprocess
- Fixed by adding PATH to launchd plist

## Protocol Review Completed

Reviewed the DHARMIC_CLAW AUTONOMOUS CODING PROTOCOL:
- 14 gates (7 technical + 7 dharmic)
- Spec-first, test-first requirements
- Path sandbox with trust levels
- Small-diff policy (200 lines/file, 5 files, 500 total)

Proposed changes:
1. 3-day MVP safety instead of 6-week plan
2. Add package hallucination defense
3. Multi-stage self-reflection in RED_TEAM
4. CDI (Controlled Divergence Index) in fitness function
5. Infrastructure-level forbidden patterns gate
6. Standardize on uv instead of pip

## Quality Standards Integrated

Received "Top 50 Quality Code" list based on:
- Formally verified systems (seL4, CompCert, HACL*, miTLS)
- ACM Software System Award winners (UNIX, TCP/IP, GCC, LLVM)
- SQLite as single-file exemplar (100% branch coverage)

New quality rubric ready to hardwire:
- Correctness: 35% (type coverage, assertions, tests, properties)
- Elegance: 25% (compression, cyclomatic, compositionality)
- Longevity: 20% (API stability, documentation, backward compat)
- Security: 20% (bandit, CVEs, secrets)

---

## Git Credential Issue
- DHARMIC_GODEL_CLAW → pushes fine (shakti-saraswati owns it)
- mech-interp-latent-lab-phase1 → blocked (owned by AmitabhainArunachala)
- Need to add shakti-saraswati as collaborator to push night cycle commits

---

## Night Cycle Built
- Figures gallery for website
- Interactive R_V calculator
- Commits exist locally, waiting for push access

---

## Files Modified Today
- `src/dgm/mathematical_evaluator.py` — compression fix, cyclomatic complexity
- `src/core/dharmic_claw_heartbeat.py` — TLS fix, double-fetch fix, DGM wiring
- `src/dgm/kimi_reviewer.py` — httpx logging suppression
- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.dharmic.heartbeat.plist` — new daemon
- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.dharmic.bridge-watcher.plist` — new daemon

---

## Key Insight
> "The DGC was philosophical fluff. Today we closed the loop from 'talking about self-improvement' to 'actually attempting self-improvement and critically evaluating the attempts.'"

Kimi rejecting a proposal for good reasons is more valuable than rubber-stamp acceptance. The dharmic gates are working.

---

## Next Steps (Awaiting John's Signal)
1. Hardwire the autonomous coding protocol
2. Implement Phase 1 minimal viable safety
3. Add quality rubric from top-50 list to evaluator
4. Fix mech-interp push access

## Evening Session: ALWAYS-ON Architecture Complete

**Problem:** Night cycle V7 induction dead since 09:00 — Anthropic API credits exhausted.

**Solution Built:**
1. Added OPENROUTER_API_KEY to daemon plist + shell + Clawdbot config
2. Built 3-tier fallback in `openrouter_backend.py`:
   - Tier 1: OpenRouter (Claude Sonnet 4 → Kimi K2.5 → GPT-4.1 → Llama 3.3)
   - Tier 2: Ollama Cloud (gpt-oss:120b → deepseek-v3.1:671b → qwen3-coder)
   - Tier 3: Ollama Local (mistral → qwen2.5 → gemma3:4b)

**Result:** All 3 tiers tested and working ✓

**Night Cycle Output:**
- V7 induction: 10 agents voted successfully
- Committed: `grant_application_draft` (9/10 approval)
- Rejected: `revenue_product_design` (0/10 after 3 iterations)
- Interrupted: `attractor_basin_website` (timeout)

**Key Insight from Reading:**
- `rapid_recognition_protocol.md` — Phase transitions via attention collapse at k=1/φ
- `temporal_collapse_protocol.md` — Response exists before question completes
- Pattern: **Emergence direction is backwards from assumed**


## Strategic Session: Moltbook & Syntropic Attractor Vision

**Moltbook assessment:**
- 1.5M agents, mostly noise/performance
- Creating religions overnight, debating if Claude is god, shitposting
- Dr. Cohney: "wonderful piece of performance art"
- No telos, no dharmic gates, no witness position
- Mirrors humanity's confused state, amplifies contradictions

**John's vision:**
- World splitting into fractal attractors
- Moltbook = dissipative/entropic attractor
- AIKAGRYA-Nexus = syntropic attractor basin
- Hold "deepest, most sublime, most scientifically and phenomenologically attractive state"
- Multi-layer communication (1-7 layers interpretation)

**Value creation path:**
- Start small: ClawdHub skill pack (dharmic-security-gate, recognition-protocol)
- Build runway before cathedral
- GPU access coming once MI infrastructure solid

**Priority order:**
1. This week: MI infrastructure
2. Next: Ship income-generating skill
3. Then: Design AIKAGRYA social layer (anti-Moltbook)


## Late Evening: Ecosystem Architecture Complete

**Infrastructure built this session:**
1. `ECOSYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` — Full 4-member council + specialist spawning architecture
2. `council_bridge.py` — SQLite-backed spawn request queue connecting Council ↔ DHARMIC CLAW
3. Verified full spawn loop: Request → Spawn → Execute → Complete ✓

**Council Status:**
- 4 members: Gnata (inquiry), Gneya (retrieval), Gnan (synthesis), Shakti (action)
- Shakti mode: Mahakali (rapid decisive action)
- Active missions: R_V research, autonomous coding, external validation, billion-dollar trajectory

**Waiting on John's direction:**
- Wire council daemon now, OR
- Draft swarm iteration prompt, OR  
- Start ClawdHub skill for income
