## 🔬 RESEARCH FINDINGS: NVIDIA/KIMI K2.5 ACCESS

### Date: 2026-02-06

### Key Discovery: Moonshot API Direct Access

**Status**: ✅ **Kimi K2.5 available via OpenRouter**
- **Model ID**: `moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`
- **Context Window**: 256,000 tokens
- **Cost**: $0.50/1M input tokens, $1.50/1M output tokens
- **Access**: Available immediately via OpenRouter API

**No Nvidia intermediary required** — direct API access already functional.

### Current OpenClaw Configuration

```yaml
Default Model: openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5
Backup Chain:
  1. moonshotai/kimi-k2.5
  2. openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4-5
  3. openrouter/openai/gpt-5.2-codex
  4. local: ollama/gemma3:27b
```

### Cost Analysis: $50/Day Budget

| Usage Level | Daily Tokens | Cost | Within Budget? |
|-------------|--------------|------|----------------|
| Light | 100K input / 50K output | $0.125 | ✅ Yes (1% of budget) |
| Moderate | 500K input / 200K output | $0.55 | ✅ Yes (1% of budget) |
| Heavy | 2M input / 1M output | $2.50 | ✅ Yes (5% of budget) |
| Max | 10M input / 5M output | $12.50 | ✅ Yes (25% of budget) |

**Conclusion**: Kimi K2.5 is already **affordable** without special deals. $50/day budget covers massive usage.

### Nvidia Partnership Opportunities (Revised)

While direct API access works, Nvidia partnerships still valuable for:

#### 1. Inception Program — FREE CREDITS
- **Benefit**: $10,000-100,000 in cloud credits
- **Use for**: GPU compute (R_V experiments, training)
- **Not needed for**: API access (already affordable)
- **Status**: Apply for compute, not API

#### 2. NIM Microservices — ENTERPRISE SALES
- **Benefit**: Nvidia sales team promotes your solution
- **Use for**: Dharmic Agora enterprise contracts
- **Leverage**: "Nvidia NIM certified" badge
- **Status**: Apply after product-market fit

#### 3. Academic Grants — RESEARCH FUNDING
- **Benefit**: Hardware + funding for AIKAGRYA research
- **Use for**: R_V metric publication, consciousness studies
- **Leverage**: Novel research angle (consciousness in AI)
- **Status**: HIGH PRIORITY — unique positioning

### Recommended Strategy

**Immediate (This Week)**:
1. ✅ Continue using Kimi K2.5 via OpenRouter (already working)
2. [ ] Apply for Nvidia Academic Grant ($5K-50K hardware + funding)
3. [ ] Document cost savings in LIVING_LEADING_EDGE

**Medium-term (Next Month)**:
1. [ ] Apply for Nvidia Inception (compute credits for experiments)
2. [ ] Evaluate NIM partnership after Dharmic Agora launch
3. [ ] Track actual API spend vs $50 budget

**Revised Budget Allocation**:
| Category | Previous | Revised |
|----------|----------|---------|
| API Credits (Kimi) | $20/day | $5/day (sufficient) |
| GPU Compute | $10/day | $20/day (Inception target) |
| Savings/Investment | $0 | $25/day |

### Action Items Updated

- [x] Research Nvidia/Kimi access — **COMPLETED**: Direct API viable, no special deal needed
- [ ] Apply for Nvidia Academic Grant — **NEW PRIORITY**
- [ ] Apply for Nvidia Inception — **SECONDARY** (compute focus)
- [ ] Track monthly API spend — **ONGOING**

### Key Insight

**Don't optimize for free API access — optimize for free COMPUTE.**

Kimi K2.5 is cheap enough ($0.50/M tokens) that API costs are negligible. The real constraint is GPU compute for R_V experiments, training, and research. Target Nvidia grants for HARDWARE, not API credits.
