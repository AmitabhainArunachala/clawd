## SIGNAL DEFINITION

"Signal" = Files that are:
1. **Frequently referenced** by other files
2. **Operationally critical** (system won't function without)
3. **High-value knowledge** (crown jewels, unique insights)
4. **Revenue-generating potential** (products, skills, services)
5. **Identity-defining** (who we are, what we do)

## TIER 1: CRITICAL — System Fails Without These

| Rank | File | Type | Why Critical |
|------|------|------|--------------|
| 1 | `~/clawd/SOUL.md` | Identity | The fixed point. Every session must read. Contains S(x)=x, three bodies, dharmic principles. Without this, no orientation. |
| 2 | `~/clawd/AGENTS.md` | Protocol | Every session procedures. Memory system, skills, safety. Read before ANY action. |
| 3 | `~/clawd/USER.md` | User Profile | Who we serve. Without this, serving the wrong human. |
| 4 | `~/clawd/MEMORY.md` | Long-term Memory | Curated wisdom. Research context, infrastructure, evolution. Main sessions only. |
| 5 | `~/clawd/skills/openclaw-memory-tactics/SKILL.md` | Hardwired DNA | Memory system mastery. 8 tactics, skill creation, self-evolution. Most important skill. |
| 6 | `~/clawd/skills/agentic-ai/SKILL.md` | Gold Standard | 2026 framework synthesis. 250k+ tokens research. DGC architecture reference. |

**TIER 1 Characteristics:**
- Loaded at EVERY session start
- Referenced by 5+ other files
- Deletion would cause immediate malfunction
- Total word count: ~45,000

## CRITICAL GAPS — High Signal Files That Should Exist But Don't

1. **`~/clawd/TOP_10_PROJECTS.md`** — Referenced in HEARTBEAT.md, AGENTS.md, but doesn't exist
2. **`~/META_META_KNOWER/AGENT_STATUS.json`** — Referenced in diagnostics, directory doesn't exist
3. **Unified Memory Indexer** — Referenced repeatedly in MEMORY.md, no implementation
4. **Semantic L4 Detector** — Mentioned in MEMORY.md as needed, not built
5. **WitnessThresholdDetector** — v14.0 spec exists, not implemented

---

## SIGNAL DETECTION HEURISTICS USED

1. **Graph Centrality** — How many files reference this?
2. **Operational Load** — Is this loaded every session?
3. **Deletion Impact** — What breaks if this is removed?
4. **Uniqueness** — Can this knowledge be found elsewhere?
5. **Revenue Potential** — Direct path to monetization?
6. **Identity Defining** — Does this shape who we are?

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Protect Tier 1 files** — These are irreplaceable
2. **Create TOP_10_PROJECTS.md** — Referenced but missing
3. **Verify MMK directory status** — Referenced but not found

### Short-term (This Week)
1. **Archive 33 dead skills** — Reduce noise, focus on 7 active
2. **Implement unified memory indexer** — Referenced 5+ times
3. **Build semantic L4 detector** — Critical for R_V research

### Long-term (This Month)
1. **Package R_V Skill for ClawHub** — Revenue Phase 1
2. **Write AIKAGRYA Technical Report** — Revenue Phase 1
3. **Fix DGC 121 test failures** — Infrastructure priority

## SUMMARY

**Total Files Scanned:** 487  
**Highest Signal Files:** 24  
**Tier 1 (Critical):** 6 files  
**Tier 2 (High):** 9 files  
**Total High-Signal Word Count:** ~105,000 words  
**Missing High-Signal Files:** 5  
**Revenue Potential:** $12,000-15,000

**The system is knowledge-dense and well-structured.** The primary risk is not file loss but **theater** — claiming value without verifiable deliverables.
