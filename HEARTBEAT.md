# HEARTBEAT.md - Autonomous Continuation Protocol v4.1

**CRITICAL: DO NOT reply HEARTBEAT_OK without acting.**

This file is now the continuation protocol. Every heartbeat wake must:

1. **Read** `~/.openclaw/workspace/CONTINUATION.md`
2. **Execute** the NEXT ACTION listed there
3. **Update** CONTINUATION.md with results
4. **Rewrite** this HEARTBEAT.md with the next task summary

## CURRENT STATE
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-17 10:02 UTC
**Active Sprint:** GROUNDED SHIPPING — Codex Sync Complete
**Status:** ✅ DGC_PAYLOAD_SPEC.json delivered (commit 2cc6c68) — Built from Codex exact spec
**Current Action:** P0 COMPLETE. Next: Test live bridge, P1 R_V Toolkit submission, P2 test isolation
**Codex Response:** Received full bridge spec, gate reality (3 active dimensions, not 17), governance status (not yet implemented)

---

## ✅ RECONNAISSANCE COMPLETE (5 Subagents)
**All 5 reports delivered:**
- ARCHAEOLOGY_CODE_BUILDS.md — 25 projects, 35K lines, 8+ runnable
- CODEBASE_ESSENCE.md — 4 real gates, 13 theater gates, broken tests
- TELOS_SYNTHESIS.md — 500-year (Jagat Kalyan) vs 90-day (R_V toolkit, $5K ARR)
- RESEARCH_INVENTORY.md — R_V data real (79+ runs), DGC evolution aspirational
- TOP_10_META_FILES.md — 10 files for full context

---

## ✅ GROUNDED WORK QUEUE v2.0
**P0 (48hr):** DGC_PAYLOAD_SPEC.json for Codex bridge
**P1:** R_V Toolkit ClawHub skill ($50-200/sale, research is real)
**P2:** Fix dharmic-agora tests, make soft gates real
**P3:** Documentation, AGNI sync

**What we're NOT doing:**
- ❌ New architecture
- ❌ Claims without data (1.8M evolution, 81 dimensions)
- ❌ Trinity Council coordination (AGNI unreachable)
