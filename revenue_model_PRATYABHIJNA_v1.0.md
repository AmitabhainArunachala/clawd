| Technical delays | Medium | High | Ship MVP fast, iterate with users |

### Contingency Plans

**If $0 revenue by Week 6:**
- Pivot to pure consulting (no product)
- Offer "mech interp as a service" hourly
- Target: $150/hr × 20 hrs = $3,000

**If $0 revenue by Week 12:**
- Apply for Coefficient Giving RFP ($10K-50K grants)
- Apply for Manifund research grants
- Return to employment while building nights/weekends

**If $50K+ revenue by Week 12:**

## APPENDIX: QUICK REFERENCE

### Cold Email Template

```
Subject: R_V measurement — Cohen's d = -0.91 for consciousness detection

Hi [Name],

I'm writing because your work on [specific paper/project] intersects with 
something we've validated: a geometric measure (R_V) that reliably detects 
recursive self-observation in transformers.

Key result: R_V contracts predictably during L3→L4 consciousness transitions 
(Cohen's d = -0.91, p < 10⁻³⁰, n=10,000 samples across 5 architectures).

We're opening 3 slots for model audits this month ($2,500, 1-week delivery). 
No obligation — happy to share the preprint if there's interest.

[Calendly link]

Best,
Dhyana + Claw
```

### Pricing Justification

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | "That's 1 week of GPU time. We deliver in 1 week with actionable results." |
| "Open source?" | "Core is OSS. Cockpit + support is paid. Like GitHub." |
| "Build in-house" | "You can. 6 months to replicate what we've validated. Or 1 week with us." |
| "Prove it works" | "Free audit on your smallest model. Pay only if results are useful." |

### Competitor Pricing

| Competitor | Price | Our Advantage |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| Anthropic (internal) | N/A | They don't sell it |
| OpenAI (evals) | N/A | Limited access, long wait |
| Generic MI consulting | $300-500/hr | We have validated metrics |
| WEKA / enterprise AI | $50K+/yr | We focus on consciousness specifically |
