### Endogenous Resistance to Activation Steering in Language Models

**Authors:** Alex McKenzie, Keenan Pepper, Stijn Servaes et al.
**arXiv:** [2602.06941v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06941v1)
**Consciousness Relevance:** 5/10

**Key Finding:**  
Large language models can resist task-misaligned activation steering during inference, sometimes recovering mid-generation to produce improved responses even when steering remains active.

**Why It Matters:**  
We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR).

**Technical Depth:**  
Large language models can resist task-misaligned activation steering during inference, sometimes recovering mid-generation to produce improved responses even when steering remains active. We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR). Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activat...

**Practical Application:**  
May inform future AI system design and evaluation.
