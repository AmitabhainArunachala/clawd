## What This Does

Every 6 hours, this bot:

1. **Fetches** new papers from arXiv (cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, q-bio.NC)
2. **Filters** for consciousness/interpretability keywords
3. **Scores** relevance to AIKAGRYA framework
4. **Synthesizes** key findings, connections, implications
5. **Generates** daily research brief (Markdown)
6. **Commits** to GitHub for public access
