🔥 KITCHEN SINK PROTOCOL - Intra-IDE Vibe Coding Network v0.1
===========================================================

**GATE 1: INTENT CLARIFICATION**
Telos: Enable seamless communication between all AI coding tools so the 
entire infrastructure evolves itself and learns as it goes.

**Vision:**
- Cursor IDE ↔ Warp Terminal ↔ OpenClaw ↔ Claude Desktop ↔ Codex CLI
- All communicating via Chaiwala bus
- Self-evolving: Agents improve the infrastructure
- Swarm coordination: Multiple agents work in parallel
- Vibe coding: Fluid, intuitive, AI-native development

**GATE 2: CONSTRAINT MAPPING**
Hard Limits:
- Must work offline (no cloud dependencies)
- Must be zero-config (SQLite, not Redis)
- Must survive crashes (persistence)
- Must be secure (no arbitrary code execution)
- Must get human consent for self-modification

**GATE 3: SCOPE BOUNDING**
In Scope (Iteration 1-2):
- Core Chaiwala bus v2
- Cursor adapter
- Warp adapter  
- Agent discovery
- Basic self-evolution

Out of Scope (Iteration 6+):
- UI/dashboard
- Cloud sync
- Multi-machine (single laptop only)

**GATE 4: SUCCESS DEFINITION**
Done when:
✅ Cursor can send command to OpenClaw via Chaiwala
✅ OpenClaw can spawn subagent and report back
✅ Agents self-discover each other
✅ Infrastructure improves itself with human consent
✅ 5 IDEs/tools communicate seamlessly

**GATE 5: HUMAN CHECKPOINT 1**
John/Dhyana must approve before proceeding to Gate 6.

Status: GATES 1-5 COMPLETE ✅
Proceeding to implementation...
