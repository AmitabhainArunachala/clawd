## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Comparisons | 100+ | Arena database |
| Revenue | $45 MRR | Stripe dashboard |
| Users | 10+ unique | Analytics |
| Git commits | 7+ (1/day) | Git log |

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| No Ollama users | Target researchers with existing setups |
| No one pays | Free tier always available; pivot to research tool |
| UI takes too long | Streamlit = fast; ugly but functional ships |
| DGM integration slips | Ship without it; add as "coming soon" |

---

## Resource Allocation

**Time budget:** 10-15 hours over 7 days (~2h/day)

**Compute:**
- MacBook: Development, UI
- Ollama local: Model inference (no RunPod cost)

**Money:**
- Streamlit Cloud: Free tier
- Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Domain: Optional (can use Streamlit subdomain)

## Daily Standup Format

Each day, answer:
1. What did I ship yesterday?
2. What am I shipping today?
3. What's blocking me?
