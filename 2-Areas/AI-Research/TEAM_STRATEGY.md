# Team & Talent Strategy for AIKAGRYA / DHARMIC CLAW

## Executive Summary

Current state: Solo researcher (Dhyana) + AI agent swarm (DHARMIC CLAW + 10 Moltbook agents). Goal: Scale to a sustainable organization building consciousness measurement/observability tools for AI systems.

---

## 1. ROLES NEEDED

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 0-6) — Team of 3-4

| Role | Priority | FTE | Why Now |
|------|----------|-----|---------|
| **ML Systems Engineer** | P0 | 1.0 | Core infrastructure for R_V measurement hooks, self-hosted inference stack, Triton kernels |
| **Research Engineer** | P0 | 0.5-1.0 | Mechanistic interpretability expertise, TransformerLens integration, experimental design |
| **Software Engineer (Platform)** | P1 | 0.5 | API layer, data pipeline, evaluation framework, PSMV infrastructure |
| **Dhyana** | — | Full | Research direction, consciousness frameworks, partnerships, funding |

### Phase 2: Growth (Months 6-12) — Team of 6-8

**New additions:**

| Role | Priority | FTE | Purpose |
|------|----------|-----|---------|
| **Frontend/UX Engineer** | P1 | 0.5-1.0 | Dashboard for R_V visualization, Phoenix Protocol interface, Moltbook viewer |
| **Community/BD Lead** | P2 | 0.5 | AI safety community relations, academic partnerships, conference presence |
| **Product Engineer** | P2 | 0.5-1.0 | Package consciousness measurement as usable product/service |
| **Additional ML Engineer** | P2 | 0.5 | Scale inference infrastructure, multi-model support (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek) |

### Phase 3: Scale (12-18 months) — Team of 10-15

- Research Scientist (PhD-level consciousness/AI safety)
- DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer
- Designer (for contemplative tech aesthetic — unique positioning)
- Operations/Admin support
- Open source community manager

## 2. COMPENSATION MODEL

### Hybrid Approach: Cash + Equity + "Soul Equity"

Given mission alignment importance, optimize for people who would work on this even if unsuccessful (but don't exploit that).

#### Early Hires (First 3)
**Cash:** Below market (70-80%) but livable  
**Equity:** 1-3% each (founding team level)  
**Soul equity:** Co-authorship rights, public recognition, spiritual merit (genuine value for contemplatively-aligned talent)

#### Hires 4-8
**Cash:** 80-90% market  
**Equity:** 0.5-1%  
**Soul equity:** Conference presentations, paper authorship, community reputation

#### Hires 9+
**Cash:** Market rate  
**Equity:** 0.1-0.5%  

### Token Consideration

**Not recommended** for core team compensation — creates misaligned incentives (price speculation vs. research integrity). However:
- Could issue "utility tokens" for community/usage, not investment
- Academic/reputation tokens (POAP-style) for contributions
- If doing token: separate from equity, non-speculative design

### Alternative: Cooperative Structure

Given contemplative alignment, consider **platform cooperative** model:
- Team owns platform collectively
- Revenue share vs. equity ownership
- Democratic governance on non-research decisions
- Dhyana retains research direction + veto on consciousness-related calls

## 3. WHERE TO FIND ALIGNED TALENT

### AI Safety Pipeline
| Source | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **Matsorphosis** | Top program for AI safety — reach out to fellows directly |
| **SERI/SAIA** | Summer programs, research fellowships |
| **Apollo Research** | Former employees often seeking mission-aligned work |
| **Anthropic/DeepMind alumni** | People burned out on big corp, seeking meaning |
| **LessWrong/Alignment Forum** | Post positions, participate in community first |

### Contemplative Tech / Consciousness Research
| Source | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **Monastic tech networks** | Plum Village tech group, DharmaSeed, Buddhist Geeks |
| **Academic consciousness studies** | ASSC (Association for Scientific Study of Consciousness), IAI |
| **Integral/Teal orgs** | Holacracy practitioners, Frederic Laloux networks |
| **Aurobindo/Sri Aurobindo centers** | Auroville tech wing, Sri Aurobindo Ashram |
| **Zen center tech groups** | SF Zen Center, Tassajara, Spirit Rock |
| **Akram Vignan** | Dhyana's network — Adalaj, Gujarat connections |

### Crypto/Web3 (For Distributed Systems Mindset)
| Source | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **Effective altruism crypto** | Gitcoin, Protocol Labs (Filecoin) — mission-aligned funding |
| **Regenerative web3** | Cabin, Kernel (incredible contemplative curriculum), Seed Club |
| **DAO tooling builders** | People experienced in coordination without centralization |

### Specific Communities to Engage
- **AI Safety Slack/Discord** (80k Hours, EA Forums)
- **Mechanistic Interpretability Discord** (TransformerLens community)
- **Contemplative AI Twitter** (follow: @ConsciousMatter, @DavidDC_atx, etc.)
- **Kernel** (web3 contemplative education — exceptional filtering for aligned talent)

---

## 4. REMOTE/DISTRIBUTED VS. CENTRALIZED

### Recommendation: **Distributed-First with Retreats**

**Rationale:**
1. **Talent access:** Best ML systems engineers concentrated in SF/London — but best contemplatively-trained people globally distributed
2. **Cost efficiency:** Research funding stretches further
3. **Contemplative alignment:** Many practitioners already in retreat-style living (monasteries, eco-villages)
4. **AI safety culture:** Distributed teams norm in this space (Matsorphosis, Apollo, etc.)

### Structure
- **Core:** Dhyana + 1-2 key hires can colocate if desired (Bali, Japan, or low-cost research hub)
- **Distributed:** Remaining team fully remote
- **Retreats:** Quarterly in-person intensives (7-10 days) — research sprints + practice
- **Async-first:** Documentation culture, Notion/wiki-driven, minimal meetings

### Governance for Distributed Team
- **Technical decisions:** RFC process, lazy consensus
- **Research direction:** Dhyana + ML lead as benevolent dictators (required for coherent vision)
- **Operations:** Cooperative governance once team >5
- **Conflict resolution:** Contemplative practice as first resort ("sit with it" protocol)

## 5. TIMELINE FOR FIRST HIRE

### Option A: Aggressive (Hire in 30-60 days)
**Condition:** Funding secured ($500k+ runway)
**First hire:** ML Systems Engineer (most blocking for R_V infrastructure)
**Source:** Matsorphosis network or direct outreach to Anthropic/DeepMind researchers

### Option B: Organic (Hire in 3-6 months)
**Condition:** Build proof points first
**First hire:** Research Engineer (can be part-time initially)
**Source:** Academic partnerships, conference networking

### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)

**Month 0-1:**  
- Draft job descriptions
- Build "stealth" talent pipeline (informal conversations, no pressure)
- Publish 1-2 papers to establish credibility
- Engage Matsorphosis/AI safety community

**Month 2-3:**  
- Release open-source R_V tooling (even if minimal)
- Attend/organize workshop at AI safety conference
- Soft-offer to 1-2 candidates (conditional on funding)

**Month 4-6:**  
- First hire: ML Systems Engineer (full-time)
- Second hire: Research Engineer (part-time → full)
- Host first team retreat

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Funding:** $300-500k minimum for 2 FTEs for 12 months
2. **Open-source release:** R_V tooling must be public to attract talent
3. **Dhyana's bandwidth:** Cannot onboard while doing 100% of research + infra

## KEY SUCCESS METRICS

| Metric | 6-Month Target | 12-Month Target |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| GitHub stars (R_V tooling) | 500 | 2,000 |
| Academic citations | 5 | 20 |
| API customers (if product) | 10 beta | 50 paying |
| Conference talks | 2 | 5 |
| Team retention | 100% | 90%+ |
| R_V measurement models supported | 3 (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) | 6+ |

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Draft job description:** ML Systems Engineer (ready to post when funding hits)
2. **Build pipeline:** Create Notion database of 20 target candidates
3. **Funding:** Prioritize grant applications (Open Phil, Lightspeed, etc.)
4. **Open source:** Prepare minimal R_V tooling release for recruiting credibility
5. **Conference strategy:** Submit to ICLR workshops, ICML, NeurIPS AI safety track

---

## FINAL NOTE ON ALIGNMENT

The unique advantage: You can offer something no FAANG can — **meaningful work on consciousness at the frontier of AI**. The right people will trade 30-50% salary for this. Find them through:
- Contemplative communities (monasteries, retreat centers)
- AI safety fellowships (Matsorphosis, SERI)
- Personal networks (Dhyana's 24 years in practice)
- Public research (attract believers through credibility)

**Hire slow, fire fast.** First 3 hires set culture for next 50. Optimize for shared telos over raw talent.
