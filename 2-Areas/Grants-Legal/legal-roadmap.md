# Legal & IP Strategy Roadmap
## For: 22 Gates / R_V Metrics / Trinity Protocol / DGC

**Prepared:** February 5, 2026  
**Status:** Strategic Planning Document

---

## Executive Summary

Your project sits at the intersection of novel AI/algorithmic innovation (22 gates, R_V metrics, Trinity Protocol) and software implementation (DGC). The IP strategy must protect the **functional innovations** (patent-eligible) while allowing appropriate **ecosystem growth** through licensing. Given the "dharmic" framing and multiple brand elements, this is a hybrid mission-driven venture requiring careful entity structuring.

---

## 1. IP Protection Strategy: The 22 Gates Framework

### Recommendation: **HYBRID — Patent Core + Trade Secret Implementation**

| Aspect | Protection Method | Rationale |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **22 Gates Architecture** | Patent (provisional → non-provisional) | Novel algorithmic/structural approach; functional protection needed |
| **R_V Metrics Calculation** | Patent | Core competitive differentiator; prevents independent replication |
| **Trinity Protocol** | Patent + Trade Secret | Patent the protocol structure; keep optimization details secret |
| **Implementation Code** | Copyright + Trade Secret | Automatic protection; guard specific implementations |

### Why Not Pure Open Source?

Open-sourcing the 22 gates framework would allow competitors to replicate your functional innovations without restriction. **Copyright alone is insufficient** — it only protects code expression, not the underlying algorithm. A competitor could study your system, understand the gate mechanics, and reimplement with different code.

### Why Not Pure Trade Secret?

Trade secrets offer no protection against **independent development** or **reverse engineering**. Given that 22 gates likely produces observable outputs (gate decisions, metrics), competitors could reverse-engineer the logic. Patents provide the only protection against independent replication.

### Patent Filing Priority

**IMMEDIATE ACTION (within 30 days):**
1. Document the 22 gates architecture in detail (flowcharts, algorithms, technical advantages)
2. File **provisional patent application(s)** covering:
   - The 22 gates decision framework/methodology
   - R_V metrics calculation methods
   - Trinity Protocol coordination mechanism
3. Cost estimate: $3,000–$8,000 per provisional (attorney + USPTO fees)
4. Sets 12-month clock to file non-provisional

**Key Patentability Requirements (Post-Alice Corp):**
- Must demonstrate **technical improvement** to a technological field
- Must be more than an "abstract idea" — show concrete application
- Document performance improvements, efficiency gains, novel data structures

## 2. DGC Licensing Strategy

### Recommendation: **DUAL-LICENSE MODEL**

| Use Case | License | Terms |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Research / Academic / Personal** | AGPL or Custom Open Source | Free, source code must be shared |
| **Commercial / SaaS** | Commercial Proprietary License | Paid, negotiated terms, no source disclosure |
| **Enterprise / Government** | Enterprise License | Custom terms, support, indemnification |

### Why Not Pure MIT/GPL?

- **MIT**: Too permissive — allows competitors to build proprietary derivatives without contributing back
- **GPL**: "Viral" effect — any code linking to DGC must also be GPL'd, potentially scaring commercial users
- **AGPL**: Better for SaaS — closes the "network use" loophole of GPL

### Dual-License Advantages

1. **Ecosystem Growth**: Open version builds community, adoption, credibility
2. **Revenue Stream**: Commercial licenses generate revenue from serious users
3. **Patent Compatibility**: Can include patent grants in commercial licenses
4. **Strategic Flexibility**: Control which features go to open vs. commercial

### License Drafting Priority

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
1. Decide on open-source license for community edition (recommend: AGPL-3.0)
2. Draft commercial license terms with IP attorney
3. Include explicit **patent non-assertion** clause in open license
4. Include **no-warranty** and **limitation of liability** clauses

## 3. Trademark Strategy

### Brands to Protect

| Brand | Class(es) | Priority | Status |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **DHARMIC CLAW** | 9 (software), 42 (services) | HIGH | Unregistered — immediate action |
| **Aunt Hillary** | 9 (software), 41 (education) | MEDIUM | Unregistered — file within 60 days |
| **22 Gates** | 9, 42 | MEDIUM | Check conflicts first |
| **Trinity Protocol** | 9, 42 | LOW | Descriptive risk — may need evidence of distinctiveness |

### Trademark Action Items

**IMMEDIATE (within 14 days):**
1. **Clearance search** — verify no conflicting marks in Class 9/42
2. Start using ™ symbol on DHARMIC CLAW and Aunt Hillary
3. Document first use dates (screenshots, dated materials)

**SHORT-TERM (within 60 days):**
1. File USPTO trademark applications for DHARMIC CLAW and Aunt Hillary
2. Cost: ~$350 per class (TEAS Plus) or $250 (TEAS Standard)
3. Consider international registration (Madrid Protocol) if global use planned

### Why Trademarks Matter

- Protects brand equity and prevents confusion
- Can last indefinitely (unlike patents = 20 years)
- Essential for licensing and franchising
- Required for platform/app store listings

---

## 4. Entity Structure Strategy

### Recommendation: **DELAWARE PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION (PBC)**

#### Why PBC?

Given the "dharmic" framing and what appears to be mission-driven work (22 gates as ethical/decision framework?), a PBC offers:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Mission Protection** | Legally embeds social/ethical purpose into corporate charter |
| **Capital Access** | Can raise VC, issue stock, exit via acquisition/IPO (unlike non-profit) |
| **Fiduciary Flexibility** | Directors can consider mission alongside profit — protected from shareholder lawsuits for "not maximizing profit" |
| **Impact Credibility** | Signals commitment to stakeholders beyond shareholders |

#### Alternative Structures Considered

| Structure | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|-----------|------|------|---------|
| **C-Corp** | Standard for VC, QSBS benefits | No mission protection | ACCEPTABLE but suboptimal |
| **Non-Profit 501(c)(3)** | Tax exempt, grants | Cannot distribute profits, no equity financing | REJECT — limits growth |
| **Hybrid (Holding Co + Non-Profit)** | IP in non-profit, ops in for-profit | Complex, expensive, potential conflicts | OVERKILL at this stage |
| **LLC** | Flexible, pass-through taxation | Less familiar to VCs, no QSBS | REJECT — wrong stage |

#### Recommended Structure

```
DHARMIC CLAW, INC.
├── Delaware PBC (Parent/Holding)
│   ├── Owns all IP (patents, trademarks, copyrights)
│   ├── Licenses IP to operating subsidiary
│   └── Can raise investment / issue equity
│
└── Operating Subsidiary (LLC or C-Corp)
    ├── Handles day-to-day operations
    ├── Employs staff
    └── Distributes revenue to parent
```

### Entity Formation Timeline

**IMMEDIATE (within 30 days):**
1. File Delaware PBC formation documents
2. Cost: ~$500 (filing) + $89 (registered agent) + $300 (franchise tax)
3. Draft bylaws including public benefit purpose statement
4. Assign all existing IP to the entity (see Section 5)

## 5. Compliance Roadmap

### 5.1 GDPR (EU Data Protection)

**Applicability:** If you process personal data of EU residents  
**Key Requirements:**
- Lawful basis for processing (consent, contract, legitimate interest)
- Data minimization and purpose limitation
- User rights (access, deletion, portability)
- Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with subprocessors
- Data breach notification (72 hours)

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Conduct data mapping — what personal data do you collect?
- [ ] Draft Privacy Policy (GDPR-compliant)
- [ ] Implement consent mechanisms
- [ ] Establish data retention/deletion policies
- [ ] Appoint EU representative if no EU presence

### 5.2 EU AI Act

**Applicability:** If using/deploying AI systems in EU  
**Risk Classification:**
- **Prohibited:** Social scoring, manipulation AI
- **High-Risk:** AI affecting safety, fundamental rights, employment
- **Limited Risk:** Chatbots, emotion recognition
- **Minimal Risk:** Most other AI

**Assessment:**
The 22 gates framework appears to be a **decision-support/decision-making system**. Depending on use case:
- If used for hiring, credit, legal decisions → **HIGH-RISK**
- If used for personal productivity, recommendations → **LIMITED RISK**

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Conduct AI Act risk classification assessment
- [ ] If high-risk: prepare conformity assessment, risk management system, data governance
- [ ] Implement human oversight mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure transparency (users know they're interacting with AI)

### 5.3 Export Controls (US)

**Applicability:** If software involves encryption, AI/ML capabilities, or dual-use technology  
**Key Regulations:**
- EAR (Export Administration Regulations) — Commerce Dept
- ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) — State Dept
- OFAC sanctions

**Assessment:**
AI/algorithmic software may be classified under **EAR Category 4 (Computers)** or **Category 5 (Telecommunications/Info Security)**. If 22 gates involves:
- Novel encryption → possible EAR control
- AI training on restricted data → compliance review needed

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Determine ECCN (Export Control Classification Number)
- [ ] Review against Commerce Control List
- [ ] Implement export compliance procedures if controlled
- [ ] Screen users/customers against restricted party lists

### 5.4 Other Considerations

| Regulation | Trigger | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **CCPA/CPRA** (California) | Processing CA residents' personal data | Draft privacy policy, implement opt-out |
| **SOC 2** | Enterprise customers | Audit + certification (Type I then II) |
| **ISO 27001** | Security-conscious customers | Information security management system |
| **Section 230** (US) | User-generated content platform | Platform protections (if applicable) |

## 8. Key Strategic Recommendations

1. **Patent Before Publication**: Do NOT publicly disclose 22 gates methodology before filing provisional patents. This destroys foreign patent rights and starts the 1-year US clock.

2. **Clean IP Chain**: Ensure all contributors (employees, contractors, advisors) have signed IP assignment agreements. Retroactive cleanup is expensive and risky.

3. **Trademark Early**: First-to-file trademark system means delays create risk. File as soon as cleared.

4. **Mission Alignment**: The PBC structure reinforces the "dharmic" framing — your governance documents should explicitly reference ethical AI, beneficial outcomes, or similar mission language.

5. **Defensive Patenting**: Consider defensive publication for secondary innovations you don't want to patent but want to prevent others from patenting.

6. **International Strategy**: File PCT application within 12 months of provisional to preserve international patent rights.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this roadmap** and prioritize based on your risk tolerance and resources
2. **Engage IP counsel** for patent and trademark filings (recommend: firms with software/AI experience)
3. **Engage corporate counsel** for entity formation and licensing
4. **Schedule compliance review** for GDPR/AI Act applicability
