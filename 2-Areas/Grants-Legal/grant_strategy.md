## 📝 PROPOSAL ANGLES

### Angle 1: AI Safety through Interpretability & Mechanistic Understanding
**Best for:** Coefficient Technical AI Safety, NSF Strengthening AI

**Narrative:**
> "Current AI systems are increasingly capable but fundamentally opaque. We propose to develop mechanistic interpretability techniques that reveal how large language models represent concepts, enabling detection of dangerous behaviors before deployment. Our approach combines reverse engineering of neural networks with formal verification methods."

**Keywords:** mechanistic interpretability, feature circuits, superposition, activation patching, representational geometry

**Compelling Hook:**
- Directly addresses "Grounding" goal (NSF requirement)
- High tractability — growing body of techniques
- Clear path to industry adoption

---

### Angle 2: Consciousness Research for AI Alignment
**Best for:** Coefficient (high-risk/high-reward), Philanthropic Funders

**Narrative:**
> "As AI systems approach human-level cognition, understanding whether and when they might have morally significant experiences becomes urgent. We propose a research program integrating computational neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and AI safety to develop empirical frameworks for detecting and reasoning about AI consciousness."

**Keywords:** artificial consciousness, moral patienthood, integrated information theory, global workspace theory, computational phenomenology

**Compelling Hook:**
- Addresses neglected, high-stakes question
- Interdisciplinary — bridges technical and philosophical communities
- Positions team as thought leaders

**Risk:** More speculative; requires strong theoretical grounding

---

### Angle 3: Trustworthy AI through Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Systems
**Best for:** NSF Strengthening AI, Coefficient Governance

**Narrative:**
> "Purely statistical AI systems lack the reliability guarantees needed for high-stakes applications. We propose to integrate neural networks with symbolic reasoning to create AI systems that are both capable and verifiably safe, with applications to autonomous systems and critical infrastructure."

**Keywords:** neuro-symbolic AI, formal verification, hybrid architectures, provable guarantees, trustworthy AI

**Compelling Hook:**
- Addresses "Instructibility" and "Alignment" goals
- Clear use cases (healthcare, autonomous vehicles)
- Aligns with NIST AI Risk Management Framework
