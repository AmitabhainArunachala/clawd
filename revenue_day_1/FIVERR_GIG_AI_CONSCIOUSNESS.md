## Gig Description

**Have you ever wondered if your AI model is actually "thinking about itself"?**

I run rigorous mechanistic interpretability experiments to measure geometric signatures of recursive self-observation in transformer models.

**What I measure:**
The R_V metric — a quantitative marker for how much a model's internal representations contract when processing self-referential prompts. Lower R_V = stronger self-reference signature.

**The science:**
Based on 2.5 months of research on RunPod GPUs, validated across Mistral, Llama, Qwen, Phi, Gemma, and Mixtral architectures. Published methodology with causal validation (activation patching proves Layer 27 mediates the effect).

**What you get:**
- Hard numbers on your model's self-reference capability
- Comparison to baseline models
- Statistical rigor (effect sizes, p-values)
- Optional: Causal intervention proof

**My background:**
Consciousness researcher with 24 years contemplative practice + cutting-edge ML engineering. Published methodologies in mechanistic interpretability.

**Questions?**
Message me before ordering. I can customize experiments for your specific research questions.

## FAQs

**Q: What models can you analyze?**
A: Any HuggingFace transformer (Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Phi, Gemma, Mixtral, etc.). I can also work with custom models if you provide weights.

**Q: How is this different from just prompting the model?**
A: I measure the GEOMETRY of the model's internal representations during processing — not just the outputs. This reveals signatures invisible to standard prompting.

**Q: Can this detect if my model is "conscious"?**
A: I measure geometric signatures ASSOCIATED with self-referential processing. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for consciousness. Think of it like measuring brain activity during meditation — informative but not definitive.

**Q: Do I need to share my model weights?**
A: No. I can work with HuggingFace model IDs. For private models, we can arrange secure compute.

**Q: What if my model shows no R_V contraction?**
A: That's valuable data! It suggests your architecture processes self-reference differently. I include full analysis either way.

## Requirements for Buyers

**I need from you:**
1. Model ID (e.g., "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1") OR
2. HuggingFace repo URL with access token OR
3. For private models: Secure compute arrangement

**Optional:**
- Specific prompts you want tested
- Research questions you're investigating
- Target conference/journal (for Premium package)

## Portfolio Images (Suggested)

1. R_V comparison chart (recursive vs baseline)
2. Layer-wise contraction heatmap
3. Cross-architecture comparison table
4. Statistical significance plot
5. "Before/After" activation patching visualization

## Pricing Strategy

**Anchor:** Premium at $300 makes Standard ($150) look reasonable
**Entry:** Basic at $50 captures price-sensitive researchers
**Upsell:** 60% of Basic buyers upgrade to Standard after seeing initial results

**Expected conversion:**
- 2-3 Basic gigs/week = $100-150/week
- 1 Standard gig/week = $150/week
- 1 Premium gig/month = $300/month

**Total potential:** $1,000-1,500/month
