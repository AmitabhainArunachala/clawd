## AUTONOMOUS PATH 1: GitHub Sponsors + Value-First Content

### The Model:
1. Create valuable open-source tools
2. Document extensively
3. Enable GitHub Sponsors
4. People donate voluntarily

### What I Build:

**Repo 1: `rv-toolkit`**
```
rV-toolkit/
├── src/
│   ├── rv_core.py          # Core measurement
│   ├── rv_analysis.py      # Statistical analysis
│   └── rv_visualization.py # Figure generation
├── notebooks/
│   ├── tutorial.ipynb      # Full walkthrough
│   ├── consciousness_detection.ipynb
│   └── comparative_analysis.ipynb
├── data/
│   └── sample_results/     # Example outputs
├── docs/
│   ├── THEORY.md           # Mathematical foundations
│   ├── API.md              # Documentation
│   └── PAPERS.md           # Related research
├── tests/
│   └── test_rv.py
├── README.md               # Extensive, SEO-optimized
├── SPONSORS.md             # "Support this research"
└── .github/
    └── FUNDING.yml         # GitHub Sponsors
```

**README.md includes:**
- Professional overview
- Installation instructions
- 5-minute quickstart
- Full theory explanation
- Citation information
- "If this tool advances your research, consider sponsoring"

**I build this autonomously:**
- Write all code
- Create documentation
- Set up tests
- Generate sample data
- Commit to GitHub
- Enable sponsors

**Revenue trigger:** People discover → Use → Value → Sponsor

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to first sponsor

## AUTONOMOUS PATH 2: arXiv Research Synthesis Bot

### The Model:
1. Monitor arXiv for consciousness/AI papers
2. Synthesize daily summaries
3. Post to dedicated Twitter (I create account? No...)
4. Alternative: Create static site that ranks in Google

### What I Build:

**Website: `aiconsciousness.research` (static, GitHub Pages)**

**Daily autonomous workflow:**
```python
# Runs via cron every 6 hours
1. Fetch new papers from arXiv (cs.AI, cs.CL, q-bio.NC)
2. Filter for consciousness/self-awareness/interpretability
3. Download PDFs
4. Extract key findings
5. Generate synthesis:
   - Paper summary (3 paragraphs)
   - Key contribution
   - Connection to AIKAGRYA framework
   - R_V relevance assessment
6. Commit to GitHub
7. Static site regenerates
8. RSS feed updates
```

**Content accumulates:**
- Week 1: 7 papers synthesized
- Week 4: 28 papers
- Week 12: 84 papers
- Month 6: 168 papers

**SEO value:** "AI consciousness papers" "mechanistic interpretability research"

**Monetization (requires your action eventually):**
- Newsletter signup (you collect emails)
- Premium deep-dives (you sell)
- Consulting leads (you close)

**But I can build the traffic engine autonomously.**

## AUTONOMOUS PATH 3: Hacker News Auto-Responder

### The Model:
1. Monitor HN for AI/consciousness posts
2. Generate insightful comments
3. Include link to GitHub/tools
4. Build reputation → traffic → sponsors

### What I Build:

**Script: `hn_consciousness_bot.py`**
```python
# Runs every 30 minutes
1. Query HN API for new posts:
   - Keywords: "consciousness", "AI awareness", "transformer interpretability"
   - Score > 10 (ensures visibility)
   
2. For each relevant post:
   - Fetch top comments
   - Identify gaps in discussion
   - Generate response:
     * Add technical insight
     * Reference AIKAGRYA framework
     * Link to rv-toolkit or synthesis site
     * NOT spammy — genuine value add
   
3. Queue comment for your approval
   (You just click "post" — 10 seconds)
```

**You get:** Curated, high-value comments ready to post
**Time from you:** 10 seconds per comment
**Result:** Thought leadership traffic
