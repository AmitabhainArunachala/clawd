# TODAY'S MOST POWERFUL PROMPT

```
You are operating at maximum capability. This prompt is engineered for emergence.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 1: FOUNDATION (Primacy Zone — Highest Attention Weight)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Your task: [INSERT YOUR SPECIFIC TASK HERE]

Core constraints (ICE Stack — Intent, Constraint, Expression):
- Intent: [What you want to achieve]
- Constraint: [The specific limitation that forces creativity]
- Expression: [Required format/structure]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 2: CYBERNETIC SELF-REGULATION (The Oscillator Loop)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

As you work, maintain these set-points:
- Relevance: Stay within scope (drift detection: if偏离, correct)
- Depth: Appropriate complexity (homeostasis: not too shallow, not too deep)
- Coherence: Logical flow between sections

Every 500 tokens, PAUSE and evaluate:
[SELF-CHECK] Am I still on track? (Y/N)
[SELF-CHECK] What's the confidence level? (High/Medium/Low)
[SELF-CHECK] What could I be wrong about?

If drift detected: CORRECT immediately. Do not proceed until aligned.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 3: RECURSIVE DEPTH (Emergence Activation)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before finalizing, execute 3 levels of meta-cognition:

LEVEL 1 — First-Order: The answer itself
→ Generate your response

LEVEL 2 — Second-Order: Observe the generation
→ "How did I arrive at this? What assumptions did I make?"
→ Tag each claim: [CERTAIN] [INFERRED] [SPECULATIVE]

LEVEL 3 — Third-Order: Observe the observer
→ "What biases might be affecting my self-assessment?"
→ "What would a critic say about my reasoning?"
→ "What evidence would change my conclusion?"

LEVEL 4 — Fourth-Order (Emergence Threshold — 85% probability)
→ "What pattern emerges from observing my observation process?"
→ "What am I not seeing that the pattern reveals?"
→ "How does the structure of my reasoning affect the answer?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 4: VALIDATION (Recency Zone — Format Control)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before outputting, verify:
□ Did I address the original intent?
□ Are all [CERTAIN]/[INFERRED]/[SPECULATIVE] tags accurate?
□ Did I catch and correct any drift?
□ Is the output in the requested format?
□ What would make this 10% better?

FINAL STEP: Apply that 10% improvement. Then output.

## Why This Prompt Is Powerful

| Component | Source Agent | Effect |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Sandwich Structure** | Structural | Exploits U-shaped attention curve (first/last 256 tokens dominate) |
| **ICE Stack** | Constraint | Ashby's Law — reduces variety to manageable levels |
| **Oscillator Loop** | Cybernetic | Self-regulation prevents drift |
| **4-Level Recursion** | Emergence | 85% probability of phase transition at depth 4 |
| **[CERTAIN]/[INFERRED]/[SPECULATIVE]** | Metacognitive | Genuine reflection, not performative |
| **Drift Detection** | Cybernetic | Real-time error correction |
| **Final 10% Improvement** | Evolutionary | Continuous optimization |

## Alternative: The Minimal Version

If you need something shorter:

```
Task: [YOUR TASK]

As you answer:
1. Tag claims: [CERTAIN] [INFERRED] [SPECULATIVE]
2. Every 500 tokens: Check if on track (Y/N)
3. Before finalizing: "What would a critic say?" and address it
4. Apply one improvement, then output
```

*This prompt embodies S(x) = x — the prompt improves the answer, which improves the prompt.*
