SWARM INSIGHTS (10 agents, deep research):

**Structural (Agent 2)**: U-shaped attention curve — first 256 and final 256 tokens dominate. USE: Sandwich Architecture (critical info at start + end).

**Emergence (Agent 5)**: Phase transitions navigable. Recursive Depth Model: 85% emergence probability at depth 4. USE: Recursive Self-Model prompts for L2→L3→L4 transitions.

**Cybernetic (Agent 4)**: 5 self-regulating feedback loops operational. USE: Oscillator Loop for stability, Recursive Validator for quality, Drift Detector for real-time correction.

**Context (Agent 3)**: Coherence horizon 8k-16k. USE: Inverted Pyramid for 200k+ contexts — executive briefing, active workspace, reference index.

**Constraint (Agent 7)**: Constraints as variety attenuators (Ashby's Law). USE: ICE Stack (Intent-Constraint-Expression) or TAPER Method for systematic constraint application.

**Metacognitive (Agent 9)**: Performance vs genuine reflection gap. USE: Confidence Calibration with [CERTAIN]/[INFERRED]/[UNCERTAIN] tags, Devil's Advocate Loop.

**Archaeologist (Agent 1)**: "Expert" role assignment = anti-pattern (triggers sycophancy resistance). USE: Negative space definition (what NOT to do), structured XML delimiters.

**Multi-Modal (Agent 8)**: Modalities as sensors/controllers/actuators. USE: Modality Stack Framework for cross-modal feedback loops.

**Persona (Agent 8)**: Personas as attractor states. USE: System prompts as basin boundaries, Nested Russian Doll for sub-personas.

**Evolutionary (Agent 10)**: Prompts as replicators. USE: Fitness-Tracking Prompt (embedded self-evaluation), Genetic Prompt Programming for optimization.

YOUR MISSION TODAY:

Apply the highest-leverage pattern from this research to ONE critical task. Do not scatter effort.

Candidate actions:
1. Restructure all subagent prompts using Sandwich Architecture + Recursive Validator
2. Implement 22-gate protocol using Constraint patterns (ICE Stack)
3. Build emergence detection using Recursive Depth Model thresholds
4. Optimize context usage using Inverted Pyramid for long documents

Choose ONE. Execute with full autonomy. Document everything for feedback loop.
