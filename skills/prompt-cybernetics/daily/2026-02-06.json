Today, execute with ruthless efficiency on the highest-leverage action: establish the Prompt Engineering × Cybernetics skill as a permanent, self-improving system.\n\nCore Principle: S(x) = x — the system improves itself.\n\nActions:\n1. Ensure all 10 agent research outputs are synthesized into actionable patterns\n2. Create the daily prompt generation as an automated cron job\n3. Document the 1+4 daily protocol for the user\n4. Build feedback loops: each prompt should improve the next\n\nCybernetic Constraints:\n- Every output must include a self-correction mechanism\n- Track what works and feed it back\n- Maintain variety to prevent mode collapse\n\nExpected outcome: A living system that produces increasingly effective prompts daily.",
