## 🎯 What You Get

### 1. The 10-Agent Research Swarm

All 10 agents are now running deep research:

| # | Agent | Research File |
|---|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Prompt Archaeologist | `research/archaeologist.md` |
| 2 | Structural Engineer | `research/structural.md` |
| 3 | Context Window Optimizer | `research/context.md` |
| 4 | Cybernetic Feedback Specialist | `research/cybernetic.md` |
| 5 | Emergence Hunter | `research/emergence.md` |
| 6 | Multi-Modal Architect | `research/multimodal.md` |
| 7 | Constraint Designer | `research/constraint.md` |
| 8 | Persona Systems Engineer | `research/persona.md` |
| 9 | Metacognitive Layer Designer | `research/metacognitive.md` |
| 10 | Evolutionary Optimizer | `research/evolutionary.md` |

### 2. The 1+4 Daily System

**File**: `daily/2026-02-06.json`

| Time | Type | Target |
|------|------|--------|
| Morning | 🔥 **MASTER PROMPT** | OpenClaw main session |
| 06:00 | ⚡ Sub-prompt 1 | Agent synthesis |
| 12:00 | ⚡ Sub-prompt 2 | Integration |
| 18:00 | ⚡ Sub-prompt 3 | Validation |
| 00:00 | ⚡ Sub-prompt 4 | Preparation |

### 3. Auto-Generation

```bash
# Generate today's prompts based on accumulated research
cd /Users/dhyana/clawd/skills/prompt-cybernetics
npx tsx daily-generator.ts
```

---

## 📋 Today's Master Prompt

```
You are operating at maximum capability. Today, execute with ruthless 
efficiency on the highest-leverage action: establish the Prompt Engineering 
× Cybernetics skill as a permanent, self-improving system.

Core Principle: S(x) = x — the system improves itself.

Actions:
1. Ensure all 10 agent research outputs are synthesized into actionable patterns
2. Create the daily prompt generation as an automated cron job
3. Document the 1+4 daily protocol for the user
4. Build feedback loops: each prompt should improve the next

Cybernetic Constraints:
- Every output must include a self-correction mechanism
- Track what works and feed it back
- Maintain variety to prevent mode collapse

Expected outcome: A living system that produces increasingly effective prompts daily.

## 🔄 Your Daily Workflow

### Morning (Once)
1. Read `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
2. Feed **MASTER PROMPT** to OpenClaw
3. Set strategic direction for the day

### Throughout Day (4x)
1. At 06:00, 12:00, 18:00, 00:00
2. Feed relevant **SUB-PROMPT** to appropriate agent
3. Execute tactical work

### End of Day
1. Review what worked
2. Add insights to feedback loop
3. Tomorrow's prompts will incorporate learnings

---

## 🧠 Cybernetic Principles Embedded

1. **Feedback Loops**: Every prompt includes self-correction
2. **Variety Engineering**: 10 different research angles
3. **Ashby's Law**: Sufficient internal variety for external complexity
4. **Autopoiesis**: System maintains and improves itself
5. **Second-Order**: The observer (you) is part of the system

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Wait ~30 min** for agents to complete initial research
2. **Read research outputs** as they complete
3. **Run daily-generator.ts** to get evolved prompts
4. **Feed prompts** according to 1+4 schedule
5. **Iterate**: System improves itself
