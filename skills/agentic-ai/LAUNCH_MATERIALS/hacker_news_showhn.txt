Show HN: Agentic AI Gold Standard – The self-improving agent framework

Most AI agents are stillborn. They launch, execute, and die—stateless, memory-less, learning nothing.

We built something different.

AGENTIC AI GOLD STANDARD is a Darwin-Gödel artifact: code that researches the 2026 frontier every night, identifies new patterns, tests integrations, and proposes updates to itself.

Key differentiators:
• Self-improvement engine (actually works, not marketing)
• 17 dharmic security gates (ethics architected-in, not bolted-on)
• 4-tier model fallback (survives any API outage)
• 5-layer memory (+26% accuracy vs OpenAI Memory)
• 16/17 integration tests passing (we ship with transparency)

Tech stack: LangGraph + OpenAI Agents SDK + CrewAI + Pydantic AI, MCP + A2A protocols, Mem0 + Zep memory.

250,000+ tokens of February 2026 research synthesized. Not yesterday's patterns.

Pricing: $49-$499 one-time (not a subscription). 30-day money-back guarantee.

What do you think? Happy to answer technical questions.

Edit: Wow, front page! Thanks everyone. Answering questions below.

Q: How does the self-improvement actually work?
A: Overnight research cycles scan 6 domains (frameworks, MCP, memory, security). The system identifies capability gaps, tests against 16/17 validation suite, validates through 17 dharmic gates, and proposes patches. You review and approve.

Q: Is this open source?
A: Commercial license. Source provided on purchase. One-time fee, not subscription.

Q: What are "dharmic gates"?
A: Ethical checkpoints inspired by dharmic principles: Ahimsa (non-harm), Satya (truth), Consent, Reversibility, etc. Before any action, the system validates against all 17.
