Title: [Launch] Agentic AI Gold Standard – Self-improving agent framework now on ClawHub

Hey r/OpenClaw community!

After 6 parallel deep dives and 250k+ tokens of research, I'm excited to share AGENTIC AI GOLD STANDARD – now available on ClawHub.

**What makes it different:**

🧬 **Self-Improving Engine** (Darwin-Gödel): The only skill that researches and improves itself overnight

🛡️ **17 Dharmic Security Gates**: Ethics architected-in, not bolted-on

⚡ **4-Tier Model Fallback**: Survives any API outage (OpenRouter → Ollama Cloud → Ollama Local)

🧠 **5-Layer Memory**: Working → Semantic → Episodic → Procedural → Meta-Cognitive

📊 **16/17 Tests Passing**: Production validated with transparency

**Quick start:**
```bash
./install.sh
python3 examples/01_hello_council.py
```

That's it. Your 4-member council is running 24/7 for $0.05/day.

**Pricing:**
- Starter: $49 (solo devs, prototypes)
- Professional: $149 (teams, production) ⭐
- Enterprise: $499 (orgs, compliance)

30-day money-back guarantee.

**Built for ClawHub:**
- Native MCP + A2A protocol support
- Works with your existing skills
- Persistent council manages other agents

Happy to answer questions! What would you like to see added?
