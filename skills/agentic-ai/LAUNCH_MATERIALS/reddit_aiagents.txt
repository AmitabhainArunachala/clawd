AGENTIC AI GOLD STANDARD — A framework that actually learns (not marketing fluff)

I'm tired of agent frameworks that:
- Are frozen in time (last updated 6 months ago)
- Have zero security (just "don't do bad things" in the README)
- Die when OpenAI has an outage
- Can't remember context across sessions

So I built something different. After 6 parallel deep dives into 2026 research (250k+ tokens analyzed), created a framework that:

**Actually self-improves**
- Overnight research cycles scan the frontier
- Identifies emerging patterns and frameworks
- Tests integrations against 16/17 validation suite
- Proposes updates to itself
- This is operational, not aspirational

**Has real security**
- 17 dharmic gates check every action
- Ahimsa (non-harm), Satya (truth), Consent, Reversibility, Containment
- The lethal trifecta of AI exploits can't form when these gates are active
- Only ethical framework in the category

**Survives outages**
- Tier 1: OpenRouter (Claude → Kimi → GPT-4.1 → Llama)
- Tier 2: Ollama Cloud (gpt-oss → deepseek-v3.1)
- Tier 3: Ollama Local (mistral → qwen2.5)
- Zero downtime, even if the internet dies

**Pre-integrated stack**
LangGraph + OpenAI Agents SDK + CrewAI + Pydantic AI + MCP + A2A

Stop choosing between frameworks. Use all of them, coherently.

**Pricing**: $49 one-time (not subscription — you own it forever)

**Launch special**: 50% off with code SHAKTI50

Install: `npx clawhub@latest install agentic-ai-gold`

Docs: 347 lines of technical depth + quick start in SKILL.md

Curious what you all think. Has anyone else solved the "agents that die" problem?
