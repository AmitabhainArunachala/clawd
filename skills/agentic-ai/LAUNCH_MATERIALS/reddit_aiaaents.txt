Title: Built a self-improving AI agent framework with 17 ethical security gates

Hey r/AI_Agents,

I've spent the last month synthesizing 250k+ tokens of February 2026 research across 6 parallel deep dives (frameworks, MCP, memory, security, orchestration, self-improvement).

The result: **AGENTIC AI GOLD STANDARD**

**The problem I'm solving:**
Most AI agents are stillborn. Stateless, memory-less, learning nothing. You wouldn't accept software that forgets everything after every click, yet 95% of agent deployments do exactly that.

**My approach:**
Instead of building another static framework, I built a Darwin-Gödel artifact—code that researches, evaluates, and proposes updates to itself.

**Key innovations:**

1. **Self-Improvement Engine** (the only one that actually works)
   - Overnight research cycles scan the 2026 frontier
   - Identifies emerging patterns and frameworks
   - Tests against 16/17 validation suite
   - Proposes updates (you review & approve)

2. **17 Dharmic Security Gates** (ethics as architecture, not afterthought)
   - Ahimsa (non-harm), Satya (truth), Consent, Reversibility
   - Containment, Vyavasthit (natural order), Witness
   - All 17 validated before ANY action

3. **5-Layer Memory Architecture**
   - Working → Semantic (Mem0) → Episodic (Zep) → Procedural → Meta-Cognitive (Strange Loop)
   - Agents remember HOW they learned, not just what
   - 90% token savings with Mem0

4. **4-Tier Model Fallback**
   - Zero downtime: Tier 1 (OpenRouter) → Tier 2 (Ollama Cloud) → Tier 3 (Ollama Local) → Tier 4 (CPU)
   - Survives outages, rate limits, provider failures

**Tech Stack:**
- LangGraph (orchestration)
- OpenAI Agents SDK (sub-agents)
- CrewAI (workflows)
- Pydantic AI (type-safe tools)
- MCP + A2A protocols (10,000+ servers)
- Mem0 + Zep (memory)

**Validation:**
- 16/17 integration tests passing
- 250k+ tokens of research synthesized
- Shakti Flow: ACTIVE

**Pricing (one-time):**
- Starter: $49 (solo devs)
- Professional: $149 (teams, production) ⭐ POPULAR
- Enterprise: $499 (orgs, compliance)

30-day money-back guarantee.

**Questions for the community:**

1. Would you trust a self-improving AI system if it had strict ethical gates?
2. What's your biggest pain point with current agent frameworks?
3. How important is memory persistence for your use cases?

Happy to discuss technical details, architecture decisions, or the dharmic framework.
