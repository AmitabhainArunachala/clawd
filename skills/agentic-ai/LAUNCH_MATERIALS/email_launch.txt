Subject: 🚀 AGENTIC AI GOLD STANDARD is Live (Self-Improving Agent Framework)

Hi [First Name],

I hope this finds you well. I wanted to share something I've been working on that I think you'll find interesting.

After 6 weeks of parallel research and 250,000+ tokens of synthesis, I've released **AGENTIC AI GOLD STANDARD v4.0** on ClawHub.

**What it is:**
A production-grade agent framework that's not static—it's a Darwin-Gödel artifact that researches and improves itself overnight.

**Why it's different:**

✅ **Self-Improving**: Scans the 2026 frontier every night, identifies patterns, tests integrations, proposes updates

✅ **17 Dharmic Security Gates**: Ethics architected-in (Ahimsa, Satya, Consent, Reversibility, etc.)

✅ **4-Tier Model Fallback**: Survives any API outage

✅ **5-Layer Memory**: Working → Semantic → Episodic → Procedural → Meta-Cognitive

✅ **16/17 Tests Passing**: Production validated with transparency

**The stack:**
LangGraph + OpenAI Agents SDK + CrewAI + Pydantic AI, MCP + A2A protocols, Mem0 + Zep memory.

**Pricing:**
- Starter: $49 (solo devs, prototypes)
- Professional: $149 (teams, production)
- Enterprise: $499 (organizations, compliance)

One-time purchase, 30-day money-back guarantee.

**Quick start:**
```bash
./install.sh
python3 examples/01_hello_council.py
```

Your 4-member Persistent Council runs 24/7 for about $0.05/day.

I'd love your feedback—whether on the technical architecture, the dharmic security model, or the business model. If you know anyone building with AI agents who might find this valuable, I'd appreciate the introduction.

**About the dharmic gates:**
These are 17 ethical checkpoints inspired by dharmic principles that validate every action: non-harm, truth, consent, reversibility, containment, natural order, and more. The only agent framework with principled security—not bolted-on, but architected-in.
