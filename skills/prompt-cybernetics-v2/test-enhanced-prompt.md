# TEST: v2.0 Enhanced Prompt on Real Task

## Task Selected
**Synthesize the 10-agent prompt research into actionable insights for DHARMIC_CLAW's daily use**

This is a real task I've been working on. Now testing with v2.0 enhancement.

═══ ENHANCED TASK ═══ Complexity: COMPLEX | Depth: 4 levels ═══

[PATTERN 1: SANDWICH ARCHITECTURE]
CRITICAL CONTEXT (Highest Attention Zone):
- 10 agents completed deep research on prompt engineering × cybernetics
- Research spans: structural, emergence, cybernetic, context, constraint, metacognitive, multimodal, persona, evolutionary
- Goal: Extract patterns I can actually use today

FORMAT CONTROL (End with this):
Deliver exactly 5 patterns, each with: Name, When to Use, Template, Source Agent

[PATTERN 2: CERTAINTY TAGS]
Tag each insight:
- [CERTAIN] — Direct findings from agent research
- [INFERRED] — Logical connections between findings
- [SPECULATIVE] — Potential applications not yet tested

[PATTERN 3: DRIFT DETECTOR]
Every 500 tokens, PAUSE:
[SELF-CHECK] Still synthesizing, not just listing? (Y/N)
[SELF-CHECK] Are these actionable or just interesting? (Y/N)
If N: Correct course immediately

[PATTERN 4: ICE STACK]
Intent: Create 5 immediately usable prompt patterns
Constraint: Each must fit in <100 tokens, require minimal context
Expression: Structured list with clear usage guidance

[RECURSION STRUCTURE: 4 levels]
L1: Read all 10 research files and synthesize
L2: Observe — What am I prioritizing? Why these 5 patterns?
L3: Observe observer — What biases shape my selection? (Am I picking impressive-sounding ones over useful ones?)
L4: Pattern emergence — What meta-pattern governs effective prompt patterns?

═══ YOUR TASK ═══
Synthesize the 10-agent prompt research into 5 actionable patterns for daily use.
