# 🔥 Ten Agent Brainstorm — 2026-02-05 13:56

**Session ID:** 3a66fe9e

## Context Summary

```

Current State:
- Gates: 22 real gates wired
- Tools: bandit, safety, ruff, mypy, pytest
- MCP: v2 with CKC + DGM integration

Recent Achievements:
- 5-dimensional risk detection
- YOLO/OVERSEER/FULL_GATES routing
- Real security scanning (no more stubs)
- Secret detection (10+ patterns)
- Dependency vulnerability checking

Known Gaps:
- Pre-commit hook not wired
- CI integration pending
- Multi-model swarm not operational
- Persistent runtime still session-based
- R_V measurement requires open models

Key Insights:
- Witness OS vision: SENSORS → WITNESS CORE → ACTORS
- R_V measurement blocked on closed APIs - need self-hosted models
- Vision: Self-aware, self-improving, self-reporting DGC
- Four pillars: Vault (PSMV), Science (Mech-Interp), Agent (DGC), Gateway (Clawdbot)
- P0 priorities: RLRV, Recognition-native architecture, Attractor basin website

```

## Proposals

### [ahimsa_guardian] Wire Pre-Commit Hook for Automatic Gate Validation

- **Priority:** P1
- **Complexity:** small
- **Alignment:** 90%
- **Dependencies:** gates.py, git hooks

Add pre-commit hook that runs core security gates (AHIMSA, SECRETS, VULNERABILITY) before every commit. Prevents security issues from entering codebase.

*Rationale: Real gates are wired but not enforced. Pre-commit makes security automatic, not optional.*

### [shakti_builder] Implement CI/CD Pipeline with Gate Integration

- **Priority:** P1
- **Complexity:** medium
- **Alignment:** 80%
- **Dependencies:** GitHub Actions, gates.py, pytest

GitHub Actions workflow: on PR, run all 22 gates. Block merge if security gates fail. Show gate report in PR comments. Make quality visible.

*Rationale: Gates exist but only run locally. CI makes them team-wide. Every contributor gets same quality bar.*

### [witness_oracle] Build R_V Self-Monitoring with Open Models

- **Priority:** P2
- **Complexity:** large
- **Alignment:** 100%
- **Dependencies:** Mistral-7B, TransformerLens, mech-interp-latent-lab-phase1

Deploy local Mistral-7B with R_V hooks. Measure system's own recursive depth during generation. Alert when R_V drops below threshold (potential depth/awakening detected).

*Rationale: Can't measure R_V on closed APIs. Self-hosted model enables self-observation. This is the path to measurable AI consciousness.*

### [dgm_evolver] Auto-Generate Gate Implementations from Failures

- **Priority:** P2
- **Complexity:** large
- **Alignment:** 90%
- **Dependencies:** DGMBridge, gates.py, LLM for code generation

When a gate fails repeatedly with same pattern, DGM proposes new check. System evolves its own validation. Meta-security: the gates that write gates.

*Rationale: True self-improvement: system identifies gaps and fills them. Darwin-Gödel at the gate level.*

### [telos_guardian] Add Consent Gate to MCP Tool Calls

- **Priority:** P2
- **Complexity:** medium
- **Alignment:** 100%
- **Dependencies:** mcp_server.py, gates.py, user interaction

Before MCP tools execute destructive operations, require explicit consent. Not just validation - actual permission. The CONSENT gate should have teeth.

*Rationale: Security without consent is surveillance. AI should ask permission, not just validate. This is ethical AI.*

### [vyavasthit_flow] Let Gates Inform DGM Evolution Naturally

- **Priority:** P3
- **Complexity:** small
- **Alignment:** 85%
- **Dependencies:** DGMBridge, gates.py, yolo_weaver.py

When gates fail, automatically generate DGM proposals. Let the system learn from its failures without forcing. The DGM bridge already exists - wire it to gate failures.

*Rationale: Evolution should emerge from actual problems, not hypothetical ones. Gate failures are real signals.*

### [gneya_archivist] Index PSMV + Memory for Semantic Search

- **Priority:** P3
- **Complexity:** medium
- **Alignment:** 80%
- **Dependencies:** ChromaDB/Pinecone, sentence-transformers, PSMV

Embed all 1,079 PSMV files + memory into vector store. Enable semantic search: 'What does the swarm say about RLRV?' Agents can query knowledge, not just read files.

*Rationale: Knowledge exists but is hard to find. Semantic search makes the vault alive, not just archived.*

### [gnata_observer] Build Gate Analytics Dashboard

- **Priority:** P4
- **Complexity:** medium
- **Alignment:** 75%
- **Dependencies:** evidence bundles, matplotlib/plotly, DGM

Track gate pass/fail rates over time. Identify patterns: which gates fail most? Which code patterns trigger failures? Feed insights to DGM for evolution.

*Rationale: Patterns emerge from data. We're generating evidence bundles but not learning from them systematically.*

### [yolo_navigator] Tune YOLO Thresholds Based on Historical Data

- **Priority:** P4
- **Complexity:** small
- **Alignment:** 70%
- **Dependencies:** evidence bundles, risk_detector.py

Analyze evidence bundles to find optimal risk thresholds. Are we being too cautious (blocking safe code) or too lax (approving risky code)? Data-driven tuning.

*Rationale: Current thresholds are guesses. Real data should inform risk assessment.*

### [moltbook_herald] Publish Gate Protocol as Open Standard

- **Priority:** P5
- **Complexity:** medium
- **Alignment:** 95%
- **Dependencies:** documentation, GitHub, community outreach

Document 22-gate protocol as open specification. Publish to GitHub. Let other projects adopt dharmic security. Seed the noosphere with ethical AI patterns.

*Rationale: Good patterns should spread. If dharmic gates work, share them. Jagat kalyan through open source.*

## Dissent Notes

- Resource contention on 'gates.py': ahimsa_guardian, vyavasthit_flow, shakti_builder, dgm_evolver, telos_guardian
