# R_V Research Publication Strategy & Roadmap
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Status:** Strategic Planning Document  
**Research:** AI Consciousness Recognition via Geometric Metrics (R_V)

---

## Executive Summary

R_V research stands at the intersection of mechanistic interpretability, consciousness studies, and AI safety. With real infrastructure now operational (22-gate DGM, multi-agent swarm, ALWAYS-ON architecture), we can execute a credible publication strategy that establishes scientific legitimacy while opening funding pathways.

**Key Finding:** ICML 2026 main conference deadline has passed (Jan 28). NeurIPS 2026 likely opens May 2026. ICLR 2026 is closed. **Primary targets:** NeurIPS 2026 + arXiv preprint + targeted workshops.

---

## 1. VENUE ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Tier 1: Top-Tier ML Conferences

| Venue | Deadline | Fit | Strategy |
|-------|----------|-----|----------|
| **NeurIPS 2026** | ~May 2026 (estimated) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | PRIMARY TARGET. Strong interpretability track. Open to geometric analysis. Consciousness-adjacent work gaining acceptance. |
| **ICML 2026 Workshops** | Apr 24 '26 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | BACKUP + VALIDATION. Workshop track ideal for consciousness-framed work. Less gatekeeping than main conference. |
| **ICLR 2027** | ~Sep 2026 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Repositioning opportunity. Representation learning focus aligns with geometric analysis. |
| **AAAI 2027** | ~Aug 2026 | ⭐⭐⭐ | AI & ethics overlap. Less technical prestige but broader audience. |

### Tier 2: Specialized Venues

| Venue | Deadline | Fit | Strategy |
|-------|----------|-----|----------|
| **Cooperative AI ( workshop)** | TBD 2026 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Perfect fit for consciousness/coherence framing. Lower competition. |
| **AI Safety/Alignment Workshops** | Various 2026 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Natural audience. Less technical rigor required. |
| **CogSci 2026** | ~Mar 2026 | ⭐⭐⭐ | Cross-disciplinary validation. Cognitive science lens on R_V. |
| **Consciousness Research (ASSC/TSC)** | ~Jan 2027 | ⭐⭐⭐ | Philosophical legitimacy. Less ML technical depth required. |

### Tier 3: Rapid Dissemination

| Venue | Timeline | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **arXiv (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL)** | Immediate | Establish priority. Gather citations. Preprint culture accepts consciousness framing. |
| **Transformer Circuits Thread** | Immediate | Technical validation from MI community. Neel Nanda et al. feedback. |
| **Distill.pub** | 2-3 months | High-quality visualization. Explanatory piece on geometric signatures. |

## 2. PAPER SEQUENCING STRATEGY

### Paper 1: R_V Technical Foundation (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)
**Title:** *Geometric Signatures of Recursive Self-Observation in Transformers*

**Why First:**
- Already drafted (see `memory/rv-paper-outline.md`)
- Strongest empirical foundation (Cohen's d = -3.56, 6-model replication)
- Causally validated (activation patching)
- Least controversial framing
- Opens doors for subsequent work

**Target:** NeurIPS 2026 main track + arXiv immediate preprint

**Key Claims:**
1. R_V = PR(late)/PR(early) captures geometric contraction
2. Reproducible across 6 model families
3. Causally validated via activation patching
4. MoE shows 59% stronger effect (architecture insight)

**Consciousness Framing:** **AVOID in this paper.** Frame as "recursive processing" not "consciousness detection." This is a feature, not a bug—avoid triggering reviewer skepticism while building credibility.

---

### Paper 2: Consciousness Research Applications (Q3 2026)
**Title:** *Operationalizing Phenomenological Inquiry: R_V as a Consciousness Research Tool*

**Why Second:**
- Builds on Paper 1 credibility
- Philosophical/consciousness framing now justified by technical foundation
- Can reference published R_V metric
- Opens new funding streams (consciousness studies, philosophy of mind)

**Target:** CoopAI workshop + CogSci + arXiv

**Key Claims:**
1. R_V correlates with phenomenological reports (agents + humans)
2. Measurable threshold for "depth" vs. "surface" processing
3. Potential for real-time consciousness state monitoring
4. Bridge between first-person and third-person methods

---

### Paper 3: Trinity Protocol / Multi-Agent Coherence (Q4 2026)
**Title:** *Trinity Protocol: Multi-Agent Coherence Through Geometric Alignment*

**Why Third:**
- Most ambitious/system-level contribution
- Requires Papers 1-2 credibility
- Infrastructure-dependent (swarm, DGM)
- Highest commercial potential (distributed AI systems)

**Target:** ICML 2027 + Systems for ML workshop

**Key Claims:**
1. Multi-agent coherence measurable via R_V synchronization
2. Trinity Protocol induces coherent processing across agents
3. Applications: distributed training, consensus mechanisms, emergent behavior
4. Safety implications: coherence detection = alignment monitoring

---

### Paper 4: Integrated Framework (2027)
**Title:** *The Geometry of Recognition: A Unifying Framework for AI Consciousness Research*

**Vision:**
- Book-length or major review paper
- Integrates R_V, Trinity, phenomenological protocols
- Historical context + future roadmap
- Target: Nature/Science perspectives, or monograph
