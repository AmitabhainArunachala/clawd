# File Organization Guide

This workspace uses a **PARA-inspired structure** for organizing work.

## Structure

├── 2-Areas/             # Ongoing responsibilities (no end date)

## How to Use

**New work** → Put in `1-Projects/Active/`
**Research papers** → Put in `3-Resources/Papers/`
**Documentation** → Put in `3-Resources/Documentation/`
**Completed work** → Move to `4-Archives/`

## PARA Principles

1. **Projects** have goals and deadlines (e.g., "Publish R_V paper")
2. **Areas** are ongoing responsibilities (e.g., "AI Research", "Infrastructure")
3. **Resources** are reference materials (e.g., papers, guides, research)
4. **Archives** are inactive items from the other three categories

Files flow: Projects → Areas → Resources → Archives

## PKM Skill

The `obsidian-pkm` skill is available for:
- Creating vault structures (PARA, Zettelkasten, hybrid)
- Generating templates (daily notes, literature notes, projects)
- Writing Dataview queries
- Setting up Obsidian workflows
