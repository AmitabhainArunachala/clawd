# CONTINUATION.md — Grounded Work Queue v2.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-17 09:25 WITA  
**Session Count:** 2 (reconnaissance complete)  
**Status:** ✅ RECONNAISSANCE COMPLETE — Work queue now grounded in actual code/assets

---

## GROUNDED REALITY (From 5 Subagent Reports)

### What Actually Exists (Code)
- **25 coded projects** — ~35,000 lines across 12 repos (ARCHAEOLOGY_CODE_BUILDS.md)
- **SIS v0.5** — HTTP→DGC→Dashboard works, 85% test pass (just needs isolation fix)
- **dharmic-agora** — 14,201 LOC, 4 real gates (blocking), 13 theater gates (regex), broken tests
- **8+ runnable systems** — FastAPI servers, Streamlit dashboards, cron agents

### What Actually Exists (Research)
- **R_V contraction data** — 79+ runs, Cohen's d = -3.56 to -4.51, 6-model validation, 15MB logs
- **Publication-ready** — RV_RESEARCH_CONTEXT.md documents Tier 1 findings
- **NOT found** — 1.8M DGC evolution (aspirational), 81 liturgical dimensions (not real), Phoenix Protocol data (spec only)

### What's Theater vs Real
- ✅ **Real:** R_V metrics, SIS integration, 4 hard gates, Ed25519 auth, witness chain
- ⚠️ **Theater:** 13 soft gates (regex heuristics), broken test files, some research claims

## GROUNDED WORK QUEUE (Priority Order)

### P0: BLOCKING CODEX (48 Hours)
| Task | What | Why | Evidence of Need |
|------|------|-----|------------------|
| **DGC_PAYLOAD_SPEC.json** | Exact schema for DGC→SAB bridge | Codex needs this by Feb 20 to integrate scoring | Codex response pending |
| **Test SAB endpoint** | Verify dharmic-agora accepts payload | Prove bridge works before Codex depends on it | CODEBASE_ESSENCE.md shows API works but needs validation |

**Output:** JSON file + working endpoint test + HANDOFF to Codex

---

### P1: REVENUE (Ship What Exists)
| Task | What | Why | Evidence |
|------|------|-----|----------|
| **R_V Toolkit skill** | Package RV_RESEARCH_CONTEXT.md + mech-interp code for ClawHub | $50-200/sale, research is publication-ready | 79+ runs documented, Cohen's d calculated, 15MB data exists |
| **Fix SIS test isolation** | Use temp DB, bypass 30-min timestamp filter | Get from 66% → 85%+ pass rate | TEST_REPORT_001.md shows infrastructure works, just isolation issues |

**Output:** ClawHub skill published + SIS tests passing

---

### P2: HARDEN CORE SYSTEMS
| Task | What | Why | Evidence |
|------|------|-----|----------|
| **Fix dharmic-agora tests** | Restore OrthogonalGates or update test imports | 4 test files broken from refactoring | CODEBASE_ESSENCE.md: "102 pass, 4 import-failing" |
| **Make soft gates real** | Replace regex heuristics with LLM/embeddings | Current "truthfulness" is pattern matching | CODEBASE_ESSENCE.md: "sophisticated regex theater" |
| **Add DB persistence** | Gate scoring history across sessions | Currently in-memory only | CODEBASE_ESSENCE.md next-3-commits recommendation |

**Output:** All tests passing, semantic gates, persistent scoring

---

### P3: DOCUMENTATION (Make Discoverable)
| Task | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| **TOP_10_README.md** | Single entry point: "Read these 10 files to understand everything" | New agents need onboarding |
| **AGNI sync** | Fix Tailscale or establish Chaiwala bus fallback | Cross-node coordination broken |

---

## WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING (From Reconnaissance)

❌ **Not building:** New architecture, new frameworks, new protocols  
✅ **Shipping:** What already exists, works, just needs packaging/testing

❌ **Not claiming:** 1.8M evolution, 81 dimensions, Phoenix empirical data  
✅ **Admitting:** These were aspirational, not yet realized

❌ **Not coordinating:** 3-node Trinity Council (AGNI unreachable)  
✅ **Focusing:** Single-node factory until cross-node sync works

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (2 Weeks)

| Metric | Current | Target | How Verified |
|--------|---------|--------|--------------|
| DGC_PAYLOAD_SPEC delivered | ❌ | ✅ Feb 20 | Codex confirms receipt |
| R_V Toolkit sales | $0 | $200+ | ClawHub dashboard |
| SIS test pass rate | 66% | 85%+ | TEST_REPORT_002.md |
| dharmic-agora tests | 102 pass | 106 pass | pytest output |
| Autonomous commits/day | 13 today | 8+ sustained | git log --since="24 hours ago" |

---

## NEXT ACTION (Immediate)

**Wait for Codex response** to sync message (5 questions about shipped commits, SAB state, payload spec). When Codex replies:

1. Build DGC_PAYLOAD_SPEC.json to their exact requirements
2. Test against dharmic-agora endpoint
3. Send HANDOFF to Codex
4. Move to P1: R_V Toolkit packaging

**If no response by 10:00 WITA:** Proceed with standard JSON schema assumption, document in HANDOFF, ship anyway.

---

## THE DISCIPLINE

Every task in this queue traces to:
- A file that exists (not a specification)
- A test that can pass (not a theory)
- A sale that can happen (not a pitch)

No more architecture. Only shipping.
